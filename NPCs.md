### Naffer Vosk - Caretaker of Sandpoint Boneyard (2 in Sandpoint at a Glance)
	A deformed smuggler Father Tobyn took pity on after his ship wrecked just north of town a decade ago. Naffer has found redemption in Sarenrae, and despite a twisted spine that from birth has given him a sinister lurching gait, he’s one of the town’s most devout citizens. He keeps the boneyard meticulously clean and is also responsible for ringing the church bells every day at dawn, noon, and dusk.	
### Garridan Viskalai - Owner of the White Deer (3 in Sandpoint at a Glance)
	A somber and quiet Shoanti man, his gruff attitude tends to make his establishment less popular than the Dragon. Garridan is the brother of Sandpoint’s sheriff, Belor Hemlock, although the two of them are in a long-running feud stemming from what Garridan sees as his brother’s complete abandonment of Shoanti tradition.
### Veznutt Parooh - Owner of the Way North (4 in Sandpoint at a Glance)
	An aged but spry gnome
### Maver Kesk - Owner of Jeweler (5 in Sandpoint at a Glance)
	A wild-haired jeweler
### Pennae Kesk - Wife of Maver Kesk
### Gorvi - Half-Ord in Sandpoint (7 in Sandpoint at a Glance)
	A fat, heavily tattooed lummox, made quite a pretty penny for himself serving as Sandpoint’s dungsweeper, enough that he employs about two dozen vagrants and curs who would otherwise be causing trouble along the boardwalk, paying them regularly in copper to haul one of his distinctive red wheelbarrows through the streets to collect refuse and garbage.
	
	Gorvi’s been making a menace of himself more than usual, spending evenings down on the boardwalk, harassing women, and raising hackles at the Hagfish (area 33). Mayor Kendra has had to ask him several times to ease up on the drinking and carousing lately, but Gorvi has grown complacent, believing that he won’t be run out of town as long as he continues to ensure the streets are clean.	
### Brodart Quint - Sage (8 in Sandpoint at a Glace)
	An old man, a balding scholar of Varisian history and engineering. Brodert claims to have spent 2 decades of his youth studying with dwarven engineers at Janderhoff and 3 decades as a cataloger at the Founder’s Archive in Magnimar, and is continually baffled and enraged that his learning and obvious intelligence haven’t afforded him more prestige. Brodert has been studying ancient Thassilonian ruins for the past several years and has recently become obsessed with the Old Light. No one believes his theories that the tower was once a war machine capable of spewing fire to a range of more than a mile.	
### Volioker Briskalberd - Locksmith - (9 in Sandpoint at a Glace)
	A flamboyant dwarf. Most of the town’s locks were built by Volioker. He’s long been an enemy of the local Sczarni (see area 42), who have used both diplomacy and coercion in their attempts to recruit him to their side. Volioker’s distaste for thievery and scoundrels may have its genesis in his childhood as a street orphan in Magnimar, although he’s traditionally close-mouthed about his past. He’s a tremendous fan of the arts, and never misses a new show at the playhouse.
### Belor Hemlock - Sherif - Horse Face
	A Shoanti who inherited the post of sheriff when the previous holder, Casp Avertin, was murdered by Chopper. Belor saw the town through that last terrible night and is generally held to be the man who stopped Chopper’s rampage. In the emergency election that followed a week later, the people of Sandpoint made his role official, and Belor became the first Shoanti sheriff of Sandpoint. Honored and eager to live up to Casp’s legacy, Belor changed his last name from Viskalai to its Chelish translation, Hemlock—a choice that has endeared him to Sandpoint’s mostly Chelish populace but hasn’t sat well with his brother Garridan (see area 3). Belor’s not-as-secret-as-he’d-like romance with Kaye Tesarani (see area 43) has put further strain on his relationship with his family.
### Kendra Deverin - Sandpoint Mayor	
	female human aristocrat
### Savah Bevaniky - Owner of Savah's Armory (12 in Sandpoint at a Glance)
### Risa Magravi - Owner of Risa's Place (13 in Sandpoint at a Glance)
	she’s gone mostly blind in her old age and has left the day-to-day affairs of the job to her three children Besk, Lanalee, and Vodger (NG human commoner 2), the mysterious Varisian sorcerer remains a fixture of the tavern. Known as much for Risa’s tales of ancient legends and myths as for its spiced potatoes and cider, this tavern is a favorite of the locals if only because its out-of-the-way location ensures strangers rarely come by.
### Larz Rovanky - Owner of Rovank Tannery (14 in Sandpoint at a Glance)
	He expects perfection from his workers and his products, and as a result often works long hours on his own during the stretches when he’s temporarily fired the help.
### 
Das Korvut - Owner of Red Dog Smithy (15 in Sandpoint at a Glance)
	A bald and powerfully muscled man. Das’s temper is, perhaps, his true claim to fame—he has little patience for customers, and even less for everyone else. Sandpoint suffers his foul-mouthed attitude and frequent drunken midnight rants because he really does know his job, and as long as he’s busy hammering metal, he stays relatively calm and confined to his smithy.
### Aliver “Pillbug” Podiker - Owner of the Pullbug's Pantry (16 in Sandpoint at a Glance)
	A short, rotund man. An accomplished herbalist, gardener, and secret poisoner. He’s of mixed Chelish and Varisian blood
### Nisk Tander - Owner of Bottled Solutions (17 in Sandpoint at a Glance)
	Half Elf. Fancies himself a more gifted potion-maker than he really is
### Jesk “Cracktooth” Berinni - Owner of Cracktooth's Taver (18 in Sandpoint at a Glance)
	Might look like a thug, but he’s actually quite well read and possesses a scathing wit—nights when he takes the stage to deliver his observations on the political situation in Magnimar are quite popular.
### Sabyl Sorn - Tends the House of Blue Stones (19 in Sandpoint at a Glance)
	Worshiper of Irori, the god of self-perfection and knowledge, Sabyl maintains a large collection of old books and scrolls in the basement chambers below.
### Chask Haladan - Owner of the Curios Goblin (22 in Sandpoint at a Glance)
	Old man who loves books
### Aesrick Battlehorn - Guildmaster of the Carpenter's Guild (24 in Sandpoint at a Glance)
	A dwarf who left his homeland because of his a nearly heretical fondness for working with wood rather than stone
### Banny Harker - Operator of the Sandpoint Lumber Mill (25 in Sandpoint at a Glance)
	A penny-pinching businessman
### Ibor Thorn - Partner of Banny Harker
### Ven Vinder - Owner of General Store (26 in Sandpoint at a Glance) - Father of Shayliss and Katyrnn - Husband of Solsta 
	Ven has a particular fondness for bitter grog and rotgut imported from places as far as the orc city of Urglin. His true prides, though, are his daughters, whom he dotes upon.
### Solsta Vinder - Wife of Ven Vinder
### Shayliss Vinder - Daughter of General Store Owner
	Slept with Ryvven, whoops.
### Katyrynn Vinder - Daughter of General Store Owner - Sister of Shayliss
	Has a budding romance with Harker from the lumber mill which her father does not approve
#### Ilsoari Gandethus - Runs Turandarok Academy (27 in Sandpoint at a Glance)
	Retired Adventurer
### Niska Mvashti - Madame Mvashti's House (28 in Sandpoint at a Glace)
	A Varisian historian and seer, part of a long tradition of oracles in her family. As with many seers, the current age’s unexpected departures from established prophecies have left her with a lifelong sense of brooding worry. She performs most of her readings with harrow cards or carved bones but seems only very rarely to enjoy casting her predictions.
### Olmur Danvakus - Guildmaster and Owner of Grocer's Hall (29 in Sandpoint at a Glace)
### Rynshinn Povalli - Owner of Vernah's Fine Clothing (30 in Sandpoint at a Glace)
	Female half elf. Rynshinn never knew her father, Iremiel, only that he was killed by goblins less than a week after she was born. Rynshinn has used much of the money from those gifts to expand her mother’s tailoring business, and even founded a guild that brings together dozens of quilters, crafters, sewers, and tailors so they can sell their wares here. She’s looking into opening a shop in Magnimar as well, but has yet to find a partner there whom she trusts. A number of Sandpoint’s young men idly court Rynshinn, whom many hold to be the town’s most beautiful citizen, but to date, she has politely eschewed all possible suitors for reasons she has not shared.
### Bilivar Wheen - Owner of Wheen's Wagon
	A down-on-his-luck wheelwright who’s lately been spending more time at various taverns (especially the Hagfish—area 33) than here working—ever since his daughter Tanethia drowned in the Mill Pond last year, his wife Vorah (LN female human commoner 1) has grown more and more shrill and paranoid that her remaining two children’s days are numbered as well. Bilivar’s been heard to mutter about packing up and skipping town to some of his drinking buddies at the Hagfish, but no one thinks he’ll really follow through on this plan.
### Courrin Whesterwill - Manager of Scanetti Mill (32 in Sandpoint at a Glace)
	Constantly worried and sneezing
### Jargie Quinn - Owner of the Hagfish - (33 in Sandpoint at a Glance)
	A gregarious one-legged man
### Turch Sterglus - Owner of Valdemar Fishmarket (34 in Sandpoint at a Glance)
	A retired fisherman with a lazy eye and a wild white beard
### Chod Bevuk - Owner of Sandpoint Meat Market (36 in Sandpoint at a Glance)
	Local Butcher. Chod still claims to this day that he encountered Chopper several days before he was ultimately caught and that the two of them fought, leaving Chod with one fewer finger, but most locals believe the wound was self-inflicted in an attempt to get attention. Chod’s penchant for lies and exaggeration in all matters not relating to his business doesn’t help lend credence to his version of how he lost the little finger of his left hand.
### Daviren Hosk - Tender of the Goblin Squash Stables (38 in Sandpoint at a Glance)
	A retired hunter whose hatred of goblins is nearly legendary in Sandpoint.
### Gaven Deverin - Owner of Two Knight Brewery (39 in Sandpoint at a Glance)
	Cousin of Mayor Deverin and worshiper of Abadar. His faith was shaken when his brother was murdered by Chopper.
### Sir Jasper Korvaski - Runs day to day of the Sandpoint Mercantile League (40 in Sandpoint at a Glance)
	In his younger years, Jasper was a paladin of Abadar, and although he’s long since given up the more dangerous lifestyle of a crusader, he remains loyal and devout. Despite his best efforts, his romance with Cyrdak Drokkus (area 23) has become one of Sandpoint’s worst-kept secrets.
### Hayliss Korvaski - Owner of Sandpoint Boutique (41 in Sandpoint at a Glance) - Sister of Jasper
	Devout worshiper of Abadar. Her temper isn’t balanced by a desire to keep everyone happy. Hayliss isn’t afraid of making enemies and wears her disdain for the Scarnettis on her sleeve. She’s even gone as far as sometimes upcharging her goods for members of the Scarnetti family, in spite of Mayor Deverin’s repeated requests to keep the peace.
### Gressel Tenniwar - Owner of Fatman's Feedbag (42 in Sandpoint at a Glace)
	An enourmous man.
### Kaye Tesarani - Owner of The Pixie's Kitten (43 in Sandpoint at a Glance)
	Sleeping with the Sheriff.
### Vorvashali Voon - Owner of the Feathered Serpent (44 in Sandpoint at a Glance)
	An exotic-looking character with bright blue eyes, long red hair, and almost bronze-colored skin, is gregarious and excited about every customer.
### Hannah Velerin - Owner of Hannah's (45 in Sandpoint at a Glance)
	Treats a lot of the sick people in town.
### Belven Valdemar - Owner of Sandpoint Shipyard (46 in Sandpoint at a Glance)
	Belven is a handsome and quite available bachelor, but his dedication to his craft and family have so far left him little time to entertain the dozens of young women who’ve been trying to catch his eye for the past several years.
### Ethram Valdemar - Head of the Valdemar Family
### Titus Scarnetti - Head of the Scarnetti Family
## Groups
### Ulongshakes - Goblin Tribe
