### **Session One: Swallowtail Festival**
Our heroes begin their tale in the town of Sandpoint during the lively Swallowtail Festival. The party consists of:

Hazel, daughter of a local baker

Vesh, a Lizardfolk serving part-time as an acolyte at the local cathedral

Ryvven and Xona, an elf and a drow adventurer, both passing through town seeking answers and finding themselves caught up in the festivities

The group partakes in various celebrations:
Hazel competes in Guildmaster Aesrick Battlehorn’s catapult game; Vesh makes several valiant attempts at the Hagfish Challenge; Xona has a sexual awakening thanks to Ameiko Kaijitsu; and Ryvven begins to question his orientation after consistently failing to shoot straight—though, to be fair, that may have been more joke than truth.

As the final event—the consecration of the new cathedral—approaches, the town is suddenly attacked by goblins, who surge forth both from the gates and from within Sandpoint itself. Chaos erupts, but Hazel first ensures the safety of her sisters, Aneka and Arika, before joining the others in the defense of the town.

The party distinguishes themselves in the fight, notably saving a nobleman named Aldern Foxglove, who is the first of many to praise their bravery. While the town guard and even local townsfolk fought admirably, it was the group of four who became the center of attention—having defended the heart of the festival at the very foot of the cathedral. Thanks to their efforts, none of the civilians near them perished.

The following day, the party meets with Sheriff Belor Hemlock and Father Abstalar Zantus, who reveal a troubling detail: during the attack, someone broke into one of the cathedral’s crypts—specifically the resting place of Father Ezakien Tobyn, the former high priest of Abadar, who died in the fire that destroyed the old church. That same fire also claimed the lives of his adopted daughter Nualia Tobyn, a young Aasimar girl once regarded as the most beautiful girl in town, and two other acolytes—Buda Innun and Yeric Entig.

Investigating the crypt, the party discovers it had indeed been disturbed—and are forced into combat with two skeletons, which they quickly dispatch.

### **Session Two: Local Heroes**
Following the events of the previous day, the party investigates the crypt further after slaying the skeletons. They find that only Father Tobyn’s bones have been taken—the other interred bodies left untouched. Despite this, Father Zantus has Vesh assist in opening and then reconsecrating the three remaining coffins. Two contain what appear to be the remains of grown men, wrapped in linen. The third is notably smaller—wrapped so tightly and thickly that it resembles a large egg sealed inside an adult-sized coffin.

Outside, the others scour the cathedral grounds. Among the tracks left behind are mostly goblin footprints—but one appears to be from a grown man, though it’s inconclusive. With the investigation complete, the party reseals the crypt without issue.

Over the next few days, the party begins to gain notoriety in Sandpoint for their heroics.

Aldern Foxglove returns to town, inviting the group on a boar hunt and presenting them with a reward in gold. While he only rents two horses for the party, he buys a personal steed for Hazel as a gift. The boar hunt leads them into the Tickwood, where they do manage to find a boar—but the encounter takes a turn when it gores Vesh in the neck with its tusks, nearly killing him. He survives, but the mood is understandably dampened by the close call.

Upon returning to Sandpoint, the party heads to the Rusty Dragon Inn, where Aldern and Xona are staying, to prepare for a celebratory feast.

Ameiko Kaijitsu begins prepping the slain boar in the kitchen.

Hazel rushes off to her family bakery to fetch fresh bread and invite her sisters. Aldern thanks her and promises to order blackberries from Korvosa for the bakery.

Meanwhile, the others disperse for the evening, and Ryvven has a noteworthy encounter.

He meets Shayliss Vinder, daughter of Ven Vinder, the owner of the local general store. With her older sister Katrine the current focus of town gossip due to an affair with the sawmill manager, Shayliss decides to stir up her own scandal. She seduces Ryvven, and they enjoy a brief romantic interlude—until her father unexpectedly returns. Ryvven barely escapes with his clothes, and there's a real chance Ven may remember his face.

(For what it’s worth, this marks the third time an elf has caused trouble and run off in Sandpoint. A trend is forming.)

Later that evening, as the party settles into the Rusty Dragon for the feast, Ameiko is in the kitchen finishing preparations when her father, Lonjiku Kaijitsu, arrives unannounced. Looking ill-tempered and worse for wear, he demands to speak with his daughter. Upon seeing the party, he begins harassing them with thinly veiled contempt. Ameiko emerges shortly after, and the two begin arguing in Minkaian. When Lonjiku attempts to grab her by the hair, Ameiko beans him on the head with a soup ladle, sending him storming out.

His parting words are sharp and cold:

“You’re as dead to me as your mother.”

Despite the unpleasant scene, the party and patrons do their best to enjoy the night. Aldern mentions that he’ll soon be returning to his estate south of town.

The next morning, Sheriff Belor Hemlock sends word, requesting a meeting between the party and a local ranger to discuss the growing goblin threat.

### **Session Three: The Glassworks**
The party starts off going to the church, where they see the finishing touches being done on the statues and other such woodwork in the church being put up.  Not far away, Sheriff Hemlock and the ranger [[Shalelu Andosana]].  She tells them that the five goblin tribes local to the area have started working together for some reason, at least as far as attacking Sandpoint together.  She plans to go check out some of the other goblin locations where they're known to live, like Shank’s Wood, Brinestump, Mosswood, or Devil’s Platter.  Hemlock himself plans to head to Magnimar soon to request reinforcements, and asks the party if they'll stay around the town to act as reinforcements in case something happens before he's back.

For the rest of the day, not much really happens.  The next morning however, when the party is meeting with Aldern for breakfast at the Rusty Dragon, one of Ameiko's employees talks to them.

Her name is [[Bethana Corwin]], and she informs them her employer has gone missing, handing them a note from Ameiko's brother Tsuto, requesting she meet him the night before.  Ameiko never came back.

So, with the potential danger in mind, they head out to the Glassworks to see if they're there.  While the doors are locked and all the windows covered on the inside, there is smoke coming from the chimneys, but they hear voices inside, and Vesh, climbing onto the roof, finds himself looking down on goblins from the glass panels up there.  Alerting the group, they move around to one of the side doors, and break in.

Easily slaughtering all the goblins except one, they discover that all the staff including Lonjiku Kaijitsu, Ameiko's father, were dead.  Lonjiku himself having the 'honor' of being turned into a glass covered statue.  While the rest of the party finished up the goblins though, Hazel chased one down that fled downstairs, where in a horror movie scene Freddy Kruger style had it shitting it's pants until Tsuto came out of his room.

He was confused to see Hazel there, Hazel was confused as well, but after he insisted Ameiko was alright and showed her to Hazel, and mentioned he was there working for Nualia, he offered to take her to see her, which she agreed.  They went down a smugglers tunnel and through a door, which Tsuto then sealed, leaving Vesh trapped in the tunnel unable to figure out where Hazel went.

### **Session Four: Revelations**
This time we start with Hazel and Tsuto in a row boat, awkwardly paddling along the coast, heading to the [[Nettlewood]].  Tsuto and her don't really talk to much, until they finally land.  Tsuto says they have to travel on foot, since the shore near the camp is unsafe.  Traveling into the woods doesn't take to long, though they quickly notice the smell of decay and lots of birds like ravens, crows, vultures in the trees around them.  Which of course leads to them getting attacked by what's known as a Carrionstorm.

While they are able to punch and strike the birds fairly easily, there are close to almost a thousand corpse birds in this swarm which surrounds them like a tornado of rotten feathers, when another arrives.

Looking like Alucard, he releases a ray of empowering sunlight that reduces the birds to ash.  He introduces himself as [[Allans Zartakov]], a cleric of Sarenrae, who was journeying out here to visit the new church when he noticed the presence of these undead.  Tsuto, not one for subtly, decides he's going to go ahead and kill this priest right there and now so he can't interfere with their plans.

He gets his shit kicked in.

They tie him up, admittedly rather poorly, though he wasn't going to try to run with them being ready to beat him up again, and they start walking back to sandpoint.

They don't get very far before their questions on the road take turn to shit talking, with Tsuto revealing he works for Nualia to destroy sandpoint, out of Nualia's desire for revenge and to be cleansed.  He also reveals she's the one that set the fire that killed Tobyn and two others, and that was because she had been left by Delek pregnant, Tobyn locked her up, and then she gave birth to a monster.  Allans gives him the chance to fight for his freedom, Tsuto loses badly and lies bleeding out, and while they first leave him to his fate, Hazel goes back after thinking about it and rips his throat out.
With the group still at the glassworks, they rescue Ameiko and then proceed to wander in the dark tunnel with no light for a while.  Eventually after slapping flint and steel together to make sparks for them to see, Xona finds incense in her bag she lights up, giving them five real life minutes of light.

Thank god for Ameiko as she finds the secret door to the cave the goblins used to get into the city.  It also had two other tunnels, one of which ended in rubble, and the other which was partially bricked up.  The group decided to head back though, except Vesh who heard something and decided to wait and see what it was.

From the bricked up tunnel, a creature emerged.  Six and a half feet tall, it looked like a horribly deformed human.  Pale emaciated flesh, with unnaturally long arms that ended in two talon tipped fingers and a thumb, and reversed legs like those of a dog.  It's head was elongated, with a pair of slits for a nose, bulging red eyes, and it's lower jaw split at the chin into pedipalps that each ended in tiny three fingered hands.

Vesh turned and fled, yelling at the others to go, and in the dark tunnel rammed straight into Ryvven, leading to them both falling down, but Xona and Ameiko booked it right out of the glassworks, yelling about goblins until they got to the garrison building, getting the attention of the guards who came out to meet them.  Hemlock, who was still there as there was a storm that delayed the ship to Magnimar, joined them to go check out the tunnels while Ameiko was taken to the church.

They walked and talked, the party catching Hemlock up, his men actually using lanterns as they descended into the tunnel.  But when they arrived in the cave, there was only one tunnel that lead out of there, the one with rubble at the end.  Telling two of his men to stay there on watch, and planning to set up a rotating watch until they could block this cave up permanently, they head back to check out the rest of the glassworks.

The trio decides to go and inform Hazel's parents at this point, with them rolling a nat 1 on life and get a door slammed in their face at their explanation of "well, we don't know how but we lost her".

After that, they head to the church.  Xona fumbling some more at social interaction, though it does come out that they never found a body of Nualia's to bury.  Instead there is something else buried in her casket in the crypt.

## Sandpoint At A Glance
### **Sandpoint Cathedral**
Easily the largest building in Sandpoint, this impressive cathedral is also the town’s newest structure. Built over the foundations of the previous chapel, Sandpoint Cathedral is not dedicated to the worship of a single deity. Rather, it gathers under its eaves the six most commonly worshiped deities in the region: Abadar, Desna, Erastil, Gozreh, Sarenrae, and Shelyn. The building provides chapels for all of these deities in a communal forum—in a way, Sandpoint Cathedral is six different churches under one impressive roof.

Yet even the previous chapel wasn’t the first holy site in this location. The core of both the original chapel and the new cathedral is an open-air courtyard surrounding a set of seven standing stones, which themselves surround a circular stone altar. These stones served the Varisians for centuries as a place of worship; although they generally venerated Desna and various Empyreal Lords at these stones, the stones themselves have a much older tradition. Unknown to anyone alive today, the seven standing stones once represented the seven Thassilonian schools of magic and served as a focus for wizards who wished to direct the destructive power of the nearby Hellstorm Flume. No one in Sandpoint suspects the standing stones are anything more than an ancient site of worship. Varisian oral tradition maintains that the seven stones represent the seven towers of Desna’s otherworldly palace, but this is merely a story perpetuated by early Varisian seers eager to hide yet another bit of their homeland’s destructive history.

The original chapel built here was a collection of six different shrines, each its own building and connected to the others by open-air walkways. Desna’s worship was incorporated into these shrines as part of the peace accord with the local Varisians, but the original builders included five other deities as well. Four of these (Abadar, Gozreh, Sarenrae, and Shelyn) were patrons of the original founders of the Sandpoint Mercantile Consortium, while the fifth, Erastil, was the most popular among the initial settlers.

When that chapel burnt to the ground several years ago, Mayor Deverin set into motion a bold initiative. Not only would the chapel be rebuilt, but it would be rebuilt on a grand scale. A cathedral would be constructed in place of the chapel, and it would be made of stone and glass. Funding for this project came partially from the founding families, partially from Sandpoint businesses eager to earn favor in the eyes of the gods, and partially from the respective churches. It took years to finish the cathedral, but the end result is truly impressive. To the south, facing Sandpoint’s heart, are the shrines of civilization: Erastil and Abadar. To the west, offering a view of the Old Light and the sea beyond, are the shrines of Shelyn and Gozreh. And to the east, offering a view of the Sandpoint Boneyard and the rising sun, are the shrines of Sarenrae and Desna.

The previous chapel hosted fewer than a dozen acolytes, led by a well-loved cleric named Ezakien Tobyn, who sadly perished in the fire that claimed the church. The new high-priest of Sandpoint is his most accomplished student, a pleasant man named Abstalar Zantus (CG male human cleric of Desna 4). Himself a worshiper of Desna, Abstalar is very open about matters of faith and has slipped into the role of advisor for worshipers of other gods of Sandpoint with ease.

### **2 Sandpoint Boneyard**
Set in the shadow of the Sandpoint Cathedral and accessible via a gate to the north or from several doors leading into the cathedral itself, this expansive cemetery overlooks the Turandarok River. Stone vaults owned by affluent members of the town stand near the cemetery’s edges or at its center, while dozens of humble plots, each marked with a simple gravestone, sit amid trees and shrubberies. The boneyard is well maintained and kept by a man named Naffer Vosk (NG male human rogue 1/cleric of Sarenrae 2), a deformed smuggler Father Tobyn took pity on after his ship wrecked just north of town a decade ago. Naffer has found redemption in Sarenrae, and despite a twisted spine that from birth has given him a sinister lurching gait, he’s one of the town’s most devout citizens. He keeps the boneyard meticulously clean and is also responsible for ringing the church bells every day at dawn, noon, and dusk.

### **3 The White Deer**
A pair of wooden life-sized deer, carved with painstaking care from white birch, stand astride the entrance to this sizable tavern and inn, which commands an impressive view of the Varisian Gulf to the north. The building is new, recently rebuilt after the previous inn at this location burnt to the ground several years ago in the same fire that destroyed the Sandpoint Chapel. The new White Deer is a grand affair, three stories tall with a stone first floor and wooden upper floors, with a dozen large rooms that can accommodate two to three guests each.

A somber and quiet Shoanti man named Garridan Viskalai (LN male human expert 4) owns the White Deer and runs the place with the aid of his family and a few locals. Although his parents were members of the Shriikirri-Quah tribe, they abandoned their ties to settle in Sandpoint. Garridan regrets their choice, but his love for his wife and family keeps him rooted firmly in town.

Eager to encourage visitors to stay at his inn, Garridan keeps the prices of his rooms and board low, matching those of the Rusty Dragon (area 37) despite the fact that his accommodations are much cleaner and more spacious. Still, his gruff attitude tends to make his establishment less popular than the Dragon. Garridan is the brother of Sandpoint’s sheriff, Belor Hemlock, although the two of them are in a long-running feud stemming from what Garridan sees as his brother’s complete abandonment of Shoanti tradition.

### **4 The Way North**
As with several other buildings in the vicinity, this one-story structure was recently rebuilt after the Sandpoint Fire. Originally a stable, the building has been converted by its owner, an aged but spry gnome named Veznutt Parooh (NG male gnome wizard 2/expert 4), into a cramped and cluttered library to house his tremendous collection of maps and sea charts. Maps of local regions, from the immediate vicinity up to the whole of Varisia and the Storval Plateau, can be purchased from him for prices ranging from 5 gp to 100 gp, depending on the size and level of detail. When not here crafting copies of old maps, Veznutt can usually be found arguing over history with his best friend Ilsoari at Turandarok Academy (area 27).

### **5 Jeweler**
This squat stone building escaped the fire that ravaged northern Sandpoint, much to the relief of its owner, a wild-haired jeweler named Maver Kesk (LG male human expert 3). Maver retains a half-dozen local toughs (LN human warrior 3) as guards, but he has a habit of leaving doors and vaults open—a trait his wife Pennae Kesk (LN female human commoner 2) often berates him for publicly.

### **6 Junker’s Edge**
Garbage gathered by Gorvi’s boys (see area 7) is routinely dumped over the edge of this cliff to gather on the beach below. Several of the town’s Gozreh worshipers (in particular Hannah Velerin; see area 45) rankle at this practice, but until an equally cost-effective and convenient option is presented, the town council is reluctant to change its ways. In any event, the sea generally makes short work of the junk, ensuring it never piles up too high.

Unknown to the citizens of Sandpoint, another reason the garbage never grows too high is the fact that goblins from the Seven Tooth tribe regularly sneak along the coast to raid the beach for bits of metal, scraps of food, not-quite-broken tools, and other “valuable” prizes. As a result, the Seven Tooth goblins have made a name for themselves among the local goblin tribes as the best traders.

### **7 Gorvi’s Shack**
This dilapidated shack is home to one of Sandpoint’s few half-orcs, a fat, heavily tattooed lummox named Gorvi (CN male half-orc warrior 3). Despite the ramshackle look of his home, Gorvi has made quite a pretty penny for himself serving as Sandpoint’s dungsweeper, enough that he employs about two dozen vagrants and curs who would otherwise be causing trouble along the boardwalk, paying them regularly in copper to haul one of his distinctive red wheelbarrows through the streets to collect refuse and garbage. Sandpoint pays him handsomely for his services, a job that no one else really wants but everyone wants to see done. Lately, Gorvi’s been making a menace of himself more than usual, spending evenings down on the boardwalk, harassing women, and raising hackles at the Hagfish (area 33). Mayor Kendra has had to ask him several times to ease up on the drinking and carousing lately, but Gorvi has grown complacent, believing that he won’t be run out of town as long as he continues to ensure the streets are clean.

### **8 Sage**
The sole occupant of this ancient building is an old man named Brodert Quink (NG male human expert 7), a balding scholar of Varisian history and engineering. Brodert claims to have spent 2 decades of his youth studying with dwarven engineers at Janderhoff and 3 decades as a cataloger at the Founder’s Archive in Magnimar, and is continually baffled and enraged that his learning and obvious intelligence haven’t afforded him more prestige. Brodert has been studying ancient Thassilonian ruins for the past several years and has recently become obsessed with the Old Light. No one believes his theories that the tower was once a war machine capable of spewing fire to a range of more than a mile.

### **9 Locksmith**
A flamboyant dwarf named Volioker Briskalberd (LG male dwarf rogue 2/expert 3) has owned and operated Sandpoint’s locksmith business since the town’s founding. Most of the town’s locks were built by Volioker. He’s long been an enemy of the local Sczarni (see area 42), who have used both diplomacy and coercion in their attempts to recruit him to their side. Volioker’s distaste for thievery and scoundrels may have its genesis in his childhood as a street orphan in Magnimar, although he’s traditionally close-mouthed about his past. He’s a tremendous fan of the arts, and never misses a new show at the playhouse.

### **10 Sandpoint Garrison**
This stone fortress serves double duty as Sandpoint’s militia barracks and its jail. The jail is located in an underground wing, while the above-ground portion houses the town’s guard. Sandpoint’s town guard consists of a dozen full-time guards (see page 373 for statistics); about twice this many servants and other experts (smiths, cooks, bookkeepers, couriers, and the like) dwell here as well. Guards patrol the city alone—there’s generally not much trouble beyond the odd drunk for them to handle, so usually only three or four are on duty at any one time.

Sandpoint also maintains a militia of 62 able-bodied men and women (human warrior 1) who are expected to attend training and exercise here at least once a week. This militia can be brought to service in 1d3 hours.

The garrison is currently under the watchful eye of Sheriff Belor Hemlock (CG male human fighter 4), a Shoanti who inherited the post of sheriff when the previous holder, Casp Avertin, was murdered by Chopper. Belor saw the town through that last terrible night and is generally held to be the man who stopped Chopper’s rampage. In the emergency election that followed a week later, the people of Sandpoint made his role official, and Belor became the first Shoanti sheriff of Sandpoint. Honored and eager to live up to Casp’s legacy, Belor changed his last name from Viskalai to its Chelish translation, Hemlock—a choice that has endeared him to Sandpoint’s mostly Chelish populace but hasn’t sat well with his brother Garridan (see area 3). Belor’s not-as-secret-as-he’d-like romance with Kaye Tesarani (see area 43) has put further strain on his relationship with his family.

The jail below the garrison is generally empty save for a few drunks or Sczarni doing time for some minor crime. Murderers and other hardened criminals generally stay for only a few days before an escort from Magnimar arrives to bring them to trial in the big city. The garrison’s jailor is a heavily scarred brute named Vachedi (CG male human barbarian 3), a Shoanti tribesman who hopes to someday earn enough money to buy back his two sons from Kaer Magan slavers.

### **11 Sandpoint Town Hall**
The majority of the ground floor of this two-story building consists of a meeting hall large enough to seat most of Sandpoint’s adults, although town meetings have rarely been even half so well attended. The upper floor contains offices and storerooms, while a vault in the basement below has functioned as the town bank for decades. Plans to build a proper bank have been stalled for various reasons since the town was founded. Sandpoint’s mayor, Kendra Deverin (NG female human aristocrat 4/expert 3), can often be found in this building, tending to the town’s needs.

### **12 Savah’s Armory**
The northeast corner of this building bears a few scars from the Sandpoint Fire, but fortunately for its owner, Savah Bevaniky (NG female human fighter 2/rogue 1), the building escaped significant damage. Savah’s shop sells all manner of weapons and armor, including several masterwork items and exotic weapons like a spiked chain, a dozen masterwork shuriken, and a +1 repeating crossbow with a darkwood and ivory stock that bears the name “Vansaya.” She’s not sure what the name means—she bought the weapon from an adventurer on the way to Riddleport a year ago, and its high price and complexity have ensured its semi-permanent stay in her shop.

### **13 Risa’s Place**
Risa Magravi (NG female human sorcerer 4) operated this tavern for the first 30 years of Sandpoint’s history, and even now that she’s gone mostly blind in her old age and has left the day-to-day affairs of the job to her three children Besk, Lanalee, and Vodger (NG human commoner 2), the mysterious Varisian sorcerer remains a fixture of the tavern. Known as much for Risa’s tales of ancient legends and myths as for its spiced potatoes and cider, this tavern is a favorite of the locals if only because its out-of-the-way location ensures strangers rarely come by.

### **14 Rovanky Tannery**
Larz Rovanky (LG male human expert 3) runs Sandpoint’s tannery, situated at the edge of town, with ruthless efficiency. He expects perfection from his workers and his products, and as a result often works long hours on his own during the stretches when he’s temporarily fired the help. His leather and fur goods are of high quality, enough so that locals generally don’t mind the extra wait for custom orders while Larz fusses with getting things perfect.

### **15 Red Dog Smithy**
Named for its owner’s affection for large red mastiffs, two to three of which can always be seen lounging about nearby, Red Dog Smithy is owned by a bald and powerfully muscled man named Das Korvut (LN male human fighter 1/expert 3). Das’s temper is, perhaps, his true claim to fame—he has little patience for customers, and even less for everyone else. Sandpoint suffers his foul-mouthed attitude and frequent drunken midnight rants because he really does know his job, and as long as he’s busy hammering metal, he stays relatively calm and confined to his smithy. The local children have recently been circulating a somewhat cruel rhyme about Das that they’ve taken to chanting at hopsquares, a doggerel sure to come to an end once the smith hears it.

“Here comes crazy-man Das Korvut,
Mad as a cut snake in a wagon rut.
See how his chops go bouncity-bounce?
How many people has he trounced?
One! Two! Three! Four...”

### **16 The Pillbug’s Pantry**
Nestled at the base of a cliff and tucked between several old tenements, nothing but a painting of a pillbug perched on a mushroom indicates this building is anything more than yet another home. The proprietor of this establishment is a short, rotund man named Aliver “Pillbug” Podiker (LE male human alchemist 5), an accomplished herbalist, gardener, and secret poisoner. Although he’s of mixed Chelish and Varisian blood, the Sczarni (see area 42) have taken to treating him as a full-blooded Varisian. While his primary source of income is from legitimate sales of medicine and potions, he maintains a healthy side-business selling poison to Sczarni locals as well. Before he’ll even admit to being a poison merchant, though, a potential customer first has to ask him, “Have any happy pillbugs turned up lately?”

### **17 Bottled Solutions**
This cluttered shop is filled with shelves upon shelves of bottles, bags, and other alchemical containers, some covered with dust and others so new that the pungent stink of their brewing still fills the air. Nisk Tander (NG male half-elf alchemist 1/expert 2) fancies himself a more gifted potion-maker than he really is—items purchased from this shop have a 5% chance of not working as intended, either being subdued, inert, or wildly unpredictable in their actual effects (such as a flask of alchemist’s fire bursting in a flash of light that acts as a daze spell in a 5-foot-radius, or a vial of antitoxin functioning instead as a vial of acid). A successful DC 25 Craft (alchemy) check can determine whether something purchased at Bottled Solutions will work or not, but Nisk doesn’t take kindly to people looking too closely at his wares before they buy.

### **18 Cracktooth’s Tavern**
A particular favorite of patrons of the Sandpoint Theater, Cracktooth’s Tavern is always full after the latest show at the nearby playhouse lets out. A large stage gives actors, singers, and anyone else the opportunity to show their stuff. Every night a crowd of would-be entertainers packs the taproom in the hopes of being discovered. Owner Jesk “Cracktooth” Berinni (NG male human expert 3) might look like a thug, but he’s actually quite well read and possesses a scathing wit—nights when he takes the stage to deliver his observations on the political situation in Magnimar are quite popular.

### **19 House of Blue Stones**
This stone building is primarily a single large chamber, the floor decorated with polished blue stones set within winding pathways of reed mats. This structure was built 10 years after Sandpoint was founded by a wandering monk named Enderaki Sorn—today, the monastery is tended by Enderaki’s daughter, Sabyl Sorn (LN female human monk 4), her father having passed away 7 years ago. A worshiper of Irori, the god of self-perfection and knowledge, Sabyl maintains a large collection of old books and scrolls in the basement chambers below. She opens both the meditation floor and her library to fellow worshipers, but others must convince her of their good intentions with a successful DC 25 Diplomacy check before she’ll let them in. Use of Sabyl’s library grants a +4 bonus on Knowledge (history) and Knowledge (the planes) checks.

### **20 Sandpoint Glassworks**
One of the oldest industries in town, the Sandpoint Glassworks has been owned by the Kaijitsu family from the town’s inception. The glassworking trade has been in the family for generations, and many of their techniques—perfected in distant Minkai—result in dazzling and impressive works that fetch top price among the nobles of Magnimar, Korvosa, and beyond. The Sandpoint Glassworks is detailed in full in Chapter One.

### **21 Sandpoint Savories**
The smells issuing from this bakery fight against the salty tang of the sea every morning except on Sunday. The shop has been owned and operated by the Avertin family for the past 2 decades. Alma Avertin (LG female human expert 7) still hasn’t quite recovered from the brutal death of her son Casp several years ago under Chopper’s blade, and her twin daughters Arika and Aneka (LG female human experts 2) all but run the business these days. Aneka doesn’t mind, but Arika is growing increasingly restless with the job.

### **22 The Curious Goblin**
The sign out in front of this shop shows a wide-eyed goblin reading an upside-down book nearly as tall as him. Inside, this bookshop is a testament to one man’s obsession with the printed word. Chask Haladan (CG male human bard 3/expert 3) has maintained his love affair with books for nearly 70 years and shows no sign of giving it up anytime soon. His store is surprisingly complete, and while almost all of his wares are far too pricey for any of the locals to shop here with any frequency, a nest egg gathered in his adventurous youth combined with a frugal lifestyle makes the success of his business secondary to his own satisfaction. Several locals, including Brodert Quink (area 8), Sabyl Sorn (area 19), and Ilsoari Gandethus (area 27) can often be found here, either chatting with Chask or sitting in one of several large chairs, reading.

### **23 Sandpoint Theater**
Brand-new cathedrals and ancient ruins aren’t the only incongruities Sandpoint boasts. This massive playhouse, financed entirely by its larger-than-life owner, Cyrdak Drokkus (CN male human bard 6), features one of the most impressive theaters on this side of Varisia—it certainly competes with the playhouses of Magnimar, a fact that Cyrdak takes great pride in, since he was forced to flee that city for mysterious reasons he’s eager to hint at but reticent to expound upon (although they certainly involve another Sandpoint local of note—Jasper Korvaski). The Sandpoint Theater often showcases local talent, but it’s the three weekend shows that locals generally look forward to. Cyrdak uses his contacts in Magnimar to great extent, ensuring that the most exciting new productions in the big city are available here as well. Although Cyrdak enjoys flirting with all of Sandpoint’s young women, his romantic relationship with Jasper (area 40) is one of the town’s worst-kept secrets.

### **24 Carpenter’s Guild**
The vast majority of the buildings in Sandpoint were erected by members of the town’s large and eternally busy Carpenter’s Guild. Currently overseen by Guildmaster Aesrick Battlehorn (LG male dwarf expert 5), a dwarf who left his homeland because of his a nearly heretical fondness for working with wood rather than stone, the Sandpoint Carpenter’s Guild has recently been accepting a growing number of projects in the outlying farmlands as well as work about town. The guild has been in a minor feud with the Sandpoint Shipyard (area 46) for years, one that most often flares up over which guild has claim to the best lumber from the mill.

### **25 Sandpoint Lumber Mill**
This long building was one of the first to be built when Sandpoint was founded. Owned by the industrious Scarnetti family, the mill and its daily operations have recently been left more and more to a penny-pinching businessman named Banny Harker (NG male human expert 3) and his partner Ibor Thorn (NG male human expert 2). Neighbors have been complaining that the two have been running their insidiously noisy logsplitter into the wee hours of the night as they rush to keep up with demand in the face of Magnimar’s increased hunger for lumber, but Harker’s influence with the Scarnettis has so far kept any mandates against operating the logsplitter from coming to pass.

### **26 General Store**
Owned and operated by Ven Vinder (LN male human commoner 7) and his family, Sandpoint’s oldest and best-stocked general store has a little bit of everything—farm equipment, weapons, tack, tools, furniture, food, and even homemade pies baked by Ven’s wife Solsta (LG female human commoner 4). Ven even keeps a shocking supply of alcohol in his basement, although a customer has to ask to see the “wine cellar” before Ven’ll admit to his special stock. Ven has a particular fondness for bitter grog and rotgut imported from places as far as the orc city of Urglin. His true prides, though, are his daughters, whom he dotes upon. Lately, he’s been increasingly distracted by what he believes is a budding romance between his daughter Katrine (NG female human commoner 1) and that no-good Harker from the lumber mill. Unfortunately, Ven’s obsession with Katrine’s nightlife has rendered him all but blind to the shameless actions of his other daughter Shayliss (CN female human commoner 1), whose reputation is growing by the month.

### **27 Turandarok Academy**
As families thronged to Sandpoint, the town founders quickly came to realize that they needed somewhere to handle the education of children, to house unfortunate orphans, and to busy older children and keep them from becoming delinquents. The answer was the Turandarok Academy. Part school, part orphanage, the academy is run by retired adventurer Ilsoari Gandethus (LN male human wizard 4/rogue 2). He volunteered to be the academy’s headmaster if he could have the basement of the two-story building to himself. The town agreed, and today, the rooms below the Academy are almost a museum of the strange things and trophies Ilsoari has collected over his years. He keeps these chambers locked, but the children who attend classes on the ground floor and the orphans who live on the upper floor have countless stories about what’s down there, ranging from a goblin farm to a nest of phantom spiders to the Sandpoint Devil itself. Although the contents are much less sinister (Ilsoari is all too happy to show off his collection of exotic weapons, strange maps, and monster trophies to anyone who asks nicely), the old wizard does nothing to dissuade the children’s tales.

### **28 Madame Mvashti’s House**
Although from outside this appears to be an ancient, decrepit manor house with several rooms, only one person lives in this old building—ancient and mysterious Niska Mvashti (N female venerable human druid 3/sorcerer 4/mystic theurge 1). Old even when Sandpoint was founded decades ago, Madame Mvashti (as she prefers to be called) is a Varisian historian and seer, part of a long tradition of oracles in her family. As with many seers, the current age’s unexpected departures from established prophecies have left her with a lifelong sense of brooding worry. She performs most of her readings with harrow cards or carved bones but seems only very rarely to enjoy casting her predictions.

Madame Mvashti had long complained that the yearly travels of her extended family hurt her bones, and when Sandpoint was founded, as part of the accord with the Sandpoint Mercantile League, the local Varisians demanded a large manor house be built for their respected elder. Once she passed away, the house was to revert to the town’s property, but Madame Mvashti has proven exceptionally tenacious and long-lived. She survives primarily on support and volunteer help from local Varisians and her only daughter, Koya Mvashti (CG female human cleric of Desna 4), although she spits and curses at those she knows belong to the Sczarni. Druids from the hinterlands make weekly visits to her home, often helping her along on the long walks she still enjoys in the nearby countryside.

### **29 Grocer’s Hall**
This building’s facade is open to the air where it faces the market. During the day, bins and trays and tables here are heaped with produce brought in that morning from the outlying farms. Near the back of the store are tools, seeds, feed, tack, and other supplies useful for farming. The other half of this building is filled with living quarters, meeting halls, file rooms, and storage. Olmur Danvakus (LG male halfling expert 4) took up the post of guildmaster here after the previous guildmaster was murdered by Chopper.

### **30 Vernah’s Fine Clothing**
Rynshinn Povalli (NG female half-elf expert 5) has owned and operated this clothing shop for the last several years. The only daughter of a kindly woman named Vernah, Rynshinn never knew her father, Iremiel, only that he was killed by goblins less than a week after she was born. At the time, Vernah’s tempestuous affair with the mysterious elven bard was the talk of the town. Every year on the anniversary of Rynshinn’s birth, a small package of elven coins, medicine, and toys mysteriously appeared somewhere in the upper floors of this building. Vernah always claimed the gifts were placed by Iremiel’s ghost, but locals generally believe the gifts were granted by one of his living relatives. Rynshinn, for her part, holds out against hope that her father somehow survived and that it’s him and not his ghost who leaves these mysterious birthday presents.

Since her mother’s death several years ago during Chopper’s murder spree, Rynshinn has used much of the money from those gifts to expand her mother’s tailoring business, and even founded a guild that brings together dozens of quilters, crafters, sewers, and tailors so they can sell their wares here. She’s looking into opening a shop in Magnimar as well, but has yet to find a partner there whom she trusts. A number of Sandpoint’s young men idly court Rynshinn, whom many hold to be the town’s most beautiful citizen, but to date, she has politely eschewed all possible suitors for reasons she has not shared.

### **31 Wheen’s Wagons**
A lanky man named Bilivar Wheen (N male human expert 3) owns this workshop. Bilivar is a down-on-his-luck wheelwright who’s lately been spending more time at various taverns (especially the Hagfish—area 33) than here working—ever since his daughter Tanethia drowned in the Mill Pond last year, his wife Vorah (LN female human commoner 1) has grown more and more shrill and paranoid that her remaining two children’s days are numbered as well. Bilivar’s been heard to mutter about packing up and skipping town to some of his drinking buddies at the Hagfish, but no one thinks he’ll really follow through on this plan.

### **32 Scarnetti Mill**
As with the Sandpoint Lumber Mill, this building is owned by the Scarnettis. All of the flower and grain produced here is supplied by local farmers. Mysterious fires have claimed the Soggy River Mill, the Biston Pond Mill, and most recently the Cougar Creek Mill, leaving Scarnetti’s the only functioning grain mill in the region. Accusations of Scarnetti-sponsored arson have been flying high, but the manager of this mill, constantly worried and sneezing Courrin Whesterwill (NG male human expert 2), has gracefully lowered the prices for its use to record lows until the outlying mills can be rebuilt, a gracious move that has alleviated, to some extent, extensive public outcry.

### **33 The Hagfish**
One of Sandpoint’s most popular taverns, especially among fishermen and gamblers, the Hagfish is also Sandpoint’s best bet for a good old-fashioned seafood meal. Owned by a gregarious one-legged man named Jargie Quinn (CG male human rogue 2/expert 2), the Hagfish gets its name from the large glass aquarium that sits behind the bar, the home of a repellent Varisian hagfish that Jargie affectionately calls Norah (despite the fact that he’s had “Norah” replaced dozens of times—Varisian hagfish don’t live all that long in Quinn’s aquarium). Hanging from a nail next to Norah’s tank is a leather pouch bulging with coins: prize money for anyone who can drink down a single tankard of “water” scooped from Norah’s tank. It costs a single silver coin to try, but the trick is that, since she’s a hagfish, the water in Norah’s tank is thick and horrifically slimy and foul-tasting. Few can stomach the stuff, but those who do get to keep however many coins have accumulated in the pouch, and then get to carve their names in the ceiling beam above the bar. To date, there are only 28 names carved there, and the Hagfish has been in business for nearly 10 years.

But there’s certainly more to this tavern than Norah. Jargie’s game tables are always well attended, with games ranging from cards to checkers to dice to darts. Tall tales are a favorite pastime here, with one popular game called “yarning” involving seeing how long a local can string along an impromptu fable without contradicting himself. The most popular subject of these tales is traditionally Old Murdermaw, a legendary giant red snapper that might or might not dwell in the depths of the Varisian Gulf. Jargie himself is quite an accomplished yarner, with the ever-changing story of how he lost his leg being his favorite starting point for his tales.

### **34 Valdemar Fishmarket**
Like the Grocer’s Guild across the market, the facade of this long building is open to the air. Here, locals can shop for the day’s catch, picking out cod, salmon, tuna, shellfish, and even the odd octopus for the evening’s meal. Turch Sterglus (LG male human rogue 1/expert 5), a retired fisherman with a lazy eye and a wild white beard, runs the fishmarket in a lovably crotchety manner, constantly complaining about the weather or the day’s catch or the antics of local youth, but always packaging his customers’ purchases with a smile and a wink. The fishmarket itself is owned by the Valdemar family, but most locals act as if the building and business were Turch’s, often tipping the lovable old man a few extra coins. Turch’s five sons, each smarter than the last, have all made careers working for their father as fish cleaners, haulers, and even cooks.

### **35 Sandpoint Market**
On most days, Sandpoint’s marketplace is empty save for the odd group of children who enjoy using the wide-open area to play whistleball or other games. Twice each week, the market fills with vendors. At the start of the week, the farmer’s market radically increases the daily selection of goods available at the Grocer’s Hall, while all day at the end of the week, merchants from Magnimar, Galduria, Nybor, Wartle, and beyond take part in the Town Market. It’s very rare to see any item worth more than a 500 gp base value go on sale at this market, but prices are generally 75% of the regular asking price.

### **36 Sandpoint Meat Market**
Local butcher Chod Bevuk (NG male human expert 3) runs the Sandpoint Meat Market. Half of this building doubles as a slaughterhouse, with the meat itself put on display for sale in the front half of the market. Most of the meat processed here is from livestock or animals caught by hunters. Chod still claims to this day that he encountered Chopper several days before he was ultimately caught and that the two of them fought, leaving Chod with one fewer finger, but most locals believe the wound was self-inflicted in an attempt to get attention. Chod’s penchant for lies and exaggeration in all matters not relating to his business doesn’t help lend credence to his version of how he lost the little finger of his left hand.

### **37 The Rusty Dragon**
This large structure is Sandpoint’s oldest inn, notable for the impressive (and quite rusty) iron dragon that looms on the building’s roof, doubling as a lightning rod and decoration. Owned and operated for the past 6 years by the lovely and popular Ameiko Kaijitsu (CG female human aristocrat 1/bard 3/rogue [rake] 1), the Rusty Dragon is not only one of the town’s most popular eateries (made so, in large part, by the spicy and exotic food served here), but also a great place to meet visitors from out of town, since most newcomers to Sandpoint come upon this inn first, as the northern stretch of the Lost Coast Road is less traveled. It certainly doesn’t hurt that Ameiko’s beauty is more than matched by her skill at music, and few are the evenings that pass without at least two or three songs being performed by the talented woman. Some bad blood exists between Ameiko and Cyrdak, and one never seems to miss a chance to badmouth the other, but no one in town really understands the reason behind their rivalry. Of greater concern to Ameiko is her long-running feud with her family—leaving town to become an adventurer scandalized her family enough. But when she retired from adventuring a year later after a disastrous mission (the nature of which she never speaks of), she returned to Sandpoint and bought and renovated the Rusty Dragon—an act that only further scandalized and shamed her father. Ameiko claims not to care about her father’s opinions of her choices, but becomes evasive when anyone asks her why she gave up the adventuring life. Some believe she has a secret lover in town, while others theorize that something happened on her last adventure that took the bravery out of her. In any event, the Rusty Dragon is probably the most adventurer-friendly establishment in town, with its ubiquitous “Help Wanted” board near the bar and Ameiko’s policy of discounting rooms for any who tell exciting adventure stories.

### **38 Goblin Squash Stables**
The sign above this door perpetuates one of the greatest fears of the lowly goblin—being trampled underfoot by a horse. The stables are tended by a retired hunter named Daviren Hosk (N male human ranger 4), whose hatred of goblins is nearly legendary in Sandpoint. In a somewhat grisly display, over the entrance to the stable’s covered barn is his collection of goblin ears: preserved and nailed to three different rafters, each bearing the goblin’s name burned into the leathery flesh—mostly because Daviren knows that writing down a goblin’s name is one of the worst things you can do to desecrate its memory. The bitter ranger’s pride and joy is a large glass bottle filled with brine in which he’s preserved the body of Chief Whartus of the now-extinct (due in large part to Daviren) Bonegrinder Tribe.

### **39 Two Knight Brewery**
While Sandpoint’s taverns offer a wide variety of spirits, they all proudly serve the mead, ale, and rum brewed here at the Two Knight Brewery. The brewery was established by two brothers (both worshipers of Abadar and cousins of Mayor Deverin) only a few years after Sandpoint was founded, and their expertise at brewing has only increased over the years. Tragically, Wade Deverin was one of the first of Chopper’s victims, a murder that has shaken the faith of his brother, Gaven Deverin (LG human male paladin 2/expert 3). Locals whisper that since Wade’s death, the brew from here simply hasn’t tasted as good, but they would never say something to this effect to Gaven’s face.

### **40 Sandpoint Mercantile League**
This large building serves many purposes. One can book passage on a ship bound for other ports, arrange for caravans or carriages for overland travel, or send messages to folk in town or as far away as Korvosa or even Riddleport. Inquiries into land ownership, building construction, and establishing new businesses, both in Sandpoint proper and in the surrounding hinterlands, must begin their processes of official foundation here. Although ownership of the league remains split evenly between Sandpoint’s four noble families, few of them take part anymore in the actual day-to-day business, leaving such matters in the capable hands of Sir Jasper Korvaski (LG male human paladin 3/expert 1). In his younger years, Jasper was a paladin of Abadar, and although he’s long since given up the more dangerous lifestyle of a crusader, he remains loyal and devout. Despite his best efforts, his romance with Cyrdak Drokkus (area 23) has become one of Sandpoint’s worst-kept secrets. The Scarnettis, easily Sandpoint’s most conservative and least open-minded family, claim to find the rumors of this relationship scandalous and offensive, but it’s unclear whether they’re more offended by the relationship itself or by the fact that the majority of Sandpoint is so accepting of it. In any event, the Scarnettis have been doing their best to make things difficult for Jasper in an attempt to not-so-subtly convince him to move back to Magnimar, but the support of the other three families has, so far, kept the Scarnettis from becoming too obnoxious.

### **41 Sandpoint Boutique**
This large boutique and shop sells all manner of clothing, weapons, toys, artwork, books, and tools imported from throughout the world, although most of the wares here are Varisian in nature. The place is owned by Hayliss Korvaski (LN female human cleric 2/expert 2), who is, like her brother Jasper, a devout worshiper of Abadar. Yet unlike her brother, her temper isn’t balanced by a desire to keep everyone happy. Hayliss isn’t afraid of making enemies and wears her disdain for the Scarnettis on her sleeve. She’s even gone as far as sometimes upcharging her goods for members of the Scarnetti family, in spite of Mayor Deverin’s repeated requests to keep the peace.

### **42 Fatman’s Feedbag**
If the Hagfish is Sandpoint’s most popular tavern, Fatman’s Feedbag is its most notorious. Bar fights are common, and Sheriff Hemlock typically has to come down here two or three times a week to sort them out when they grow particularly violent or loud. The majority of the clientele here are Varisian scoundrels or less-than-reputable sailors.

Most believe this tavern is owned and operated by an enormous man named Gressel Tenniwar (CN male human rogue 2/expert 1), but in fact the owner is a lanky thug named Jubrayl Vhiski (NE male human rogue 7), one of the Feedbag’s regulars. Jubrayl is also the leader of the local gang of Sczarni, an extended network of Varisian thieves, highwaymen, con artists, graverobbers, smugglers, and murderers. Nearly two dozen of the Varisians in Sandpoint are Sczarni as well, all cruel and self-serving men and women who take care to maintain respectable jobs as laborers, fishermen, and hunters, but who draw their true income taking part in various scams and stunts. Sheriff Hemlock suspects that Jubrayl is the local leader, and would like nothing more than to bring him in, but the Sczarni are experts at walking the line between legalities and taking the blame for their direct superiors. So while Sheriff Hemlock has sent many of Jubrayl’s boys to jail over the last several years, he’s never even come close to the ringleader himself, much to the continued amusement  of Jubrayl.

### **43 The Pixie’s Kitten**
Many of Sandpoint’s crasser locals have a much more colorful name for this establishment, but Kaye Tesarani (CG female human rogue 3/sorcerer 1) runs the town brothel with class and distinguished grace. She pays her girls and boys quite well, and the three Shoanti bouncers she employs (CG human male barbarian 3) are more than enough to handle troublemakers. Although prostitution isn’t illegal in Sandpoint, the Scarnettis have long lobbied for it to be outlawed, publicly condemning the Kitten as a place where vice and criminal activity can take root. Behind closed doors, however, Jubrayl has tried for the last several years to get in on the brothel business himself, but Kaye’s not-so-secret friendship (and romance) with the town’s sheriff make this a delicate, long-term goal for the Sczarni at best.

### **44 The Feathered Serpent**
This cramped and cluttered shop smells of a strange mixture of incense, spice, and dust. Its sole proprietor, Vorvashali Voon (LN male human wizard 2/rogue 2/expert 2), an exotic-looking character with bright blue eyes, long red hair, and almost bronze-colored skin, is gregarious and excited about every customer. Not everything in his shop is for sale, rendering the shop’s eclectic collection of strange relics, statues, and monument fragments part museum. Vorvashali’s stock changes constantly, as his dozens of contacts from Magnimar come in weekly to buy and trade stock. Adventurers seeking magic items and other tools of the trade can find what they’re looking for here more often than not.

### **45 Hannah’s**
While Abstalar Zantus (area 1) does his best to take care of Sandpoint’s truly sick and needy, he can’t help everyone. For minor aches, pains, and illnesses, most of Sandpoint’s citizens depend on Hannah Velerin (NG female elf cleric of Gozreh 3/expert 1). Hannah spends most of her mornings out in the surrounding wilds, gathering herbs or simply enjoying Gozreh’s bounty. In the afternoons, she returns to her shop and home here to prepare medicines and receive patients. Hannah’s ironically the one to go to when one either wants to end a pregnancy or needs a midwife to aid in a birth; Hannah encourages all of the women she sees to carry to term, and advises the use of pinberry extract to young women as a way to prevent any unwanted pregnancies from happening in the first place, but in cases where there’s no other option, her other services are discreet and confidential.

### **46 Sandpoint Shipyard**
The southern facade of this long building is open to Sandpoint Harbor, allowing its small army of shipwrights, ropemakers, and sailmakers to work their trade in one of four dry docks right on the shore. The shipyard is owned by the Valdemars, with Belven Valdemar (NG male human aristocrat 1/expert 5), old Ethram’s eldest son, overseeing the constant work here. Belven is a handsome and quite available bachelor, but his dedication to his craft and family have so far left him little time to entertain the dozens of young women who’ve been trying to catch his eye for the past several years.

### **47 Valdemar Manor**
This manor house commands a breathtaking view of the town of Sandpoint and the harbor below, as befits the home of the family most connected to the town’s shipbuilding and fishing industries. The family itself remains under the patriarchal rule of old Ethram Valdemar (NG male human aristocrat 5/expert 2), the only one of the original members of the Sandpoint Mercantile League who is still alive. Ethram’s years are numbered, though, for the old man has a persistent lung infection that keeps coming back, no matter how often the family pays to have it cured.

### **48 Scarnetti Manor**
The Scarnettis are Sandpoint’s most notorious noble family, and many of Sandpoint’s elderly Varisian locals still haven’t forgotten or forgiven Alamon Scarnetti’s assault on their people more than 40 years ago, even with Alamon 20 years in the ground at the Sandpoint Cemetery. The Scarnetti family, now headed by Alamon’s only surviving son Titus Scarnetti (LN male human aristocrat 6), controls Sandpoint’s mills and the lumber industry. Their control over the lumber the Valdemars need for their enterprises is not lost on the Scarnettis, and they use this fact as often as possible to leverage Valdemar support. The Scarnettis are easily Sandpoint’s most traditional family, who cling to old Chelish values that are, in many cases, outdated today.

### **49 Kaijitsu Manor**
This manor is the smallest of the four noble houses overlooking Sandpoint, yet the Kaijitsus are perhaps the richest family in town. What this manor lacks in stature and size it more than makes up for in the exotic and impressive furnishings within. Lonjiku Kaijitsu (LN aristocrat 3/expert 2) has carried on his father’s proud work as glassmaker, and the Sandpoint Glassworks is perhaps the town’s most prosperous business, with its products regularly shipped as far as Korvosa. Lonjiku’s accomplishments are all the more impressive when one takes into account that he and his family are relative newcomers to Varisia, the survivors of an exiled family from Minkai who fled over the Crown of the World a half century ago for unknown reasons. Lonjiku was born in Magnimar and has never visited his motherland, but he carries memories of its wonders in the form of stories told to him by his now-deceased parents. Yet for all of his success at business, Lonjiku has found the role of father to be one he’s particularly ill suited for. His eldest son Tsuto, in addition to being proof of his wife’s affair with an unknown elf, left the region several years ago after an argument that resulted in Lonjiku striking his son with his cane. His eldest daughter Ameiko shamed him not only by becoming an adventurer, but also by opening and running a tavern and flophouse—“hardly women’s work,” he’s fond of telling anyone who’ll listen. Of course, those who know Lonjiku know his short temper is his real problem.

### **50 Deverin Manor**
Living within the largest manor, the Deverins have traditionally held leadership roles in Sandpoint. Old Amos Deverin served as the town’s first mayor for 23 years, and his son Fenchus served as its second. Both Deverins perished after unfortunate accidents (Amos was trampled by a runaway horse on Festival street and Fenchus was killed by a snakebite while on a boar hunt), leaving Amos’s youngest daughter as the heir to the family fortune and a likely candidate for mayor. Kendra Deverin (NG female human aristocrat 4/expert 3) didn’t initially want the job, but after she was nominated for the role by her close friend Casp Avertin, she won the election by a landslide, something her primary opponent in the election, Titus Scarnetti, has never quite come to terms with. For some time there was talk of her and Casp becoming wife and husband, but Casp’s death at Chopper’s hands cut that short. Kendra’s recovered now from the shock, but has put aside all interest in romance for politics. She shares this manor with her brother’s rather large family, and although her sister-in-law Vana constantly complains about needing even more space and luxuries, Kendra has done a saintly job so far in keeping her temper under control.

## Nualia's Journal
### **Entry  - 28 Gozran, 4690 AR**
I started school recently.  A lot of the other children are mean to me.  They pick on me,  tease me, call me things like bright eyes or little grandma or fallen angel.  They treat me like i’m a freak!.  Some of the boys were making fun of me, saying that if they touched me it’d cure illnesses they had.  So they’d run by as fast as they could and touch me, but they were running so fast that it hurt, and then they just started to do it faster and faster and faster and it hurt so much.  Headmaster Gandethus stops them from picking on me, but he’s not always there and then they’re meaner to me.  Why are they so mean to me?  I didn’t ask to be like this…  Father tells me this is my blessing from the gods.  I pray to them every night.  I want to know why I was made like this…

### **Entry  -  8 Desnus, 4693 AR**
There’s a couple of new kids at the academy.  The little sister of those twins, Aneka and Arika, Hazel.  Apparently she’s adopted too.  She’s got weird eyes.  One red and one blue.  Rumor has it that she had claws in the basket, and father Tobyn says they shouldn’t have taken her in, says she’s a bad omen.  Tsuto just gets angry looking at her for her eye shape and hair or something.  I don’t know if I should talk to her though, her sisters give mean looks to anyone that says mean things to her, but they’ve also said some mean things about me…..

### **Entry  - 8 Sarenith, 4693 AR**
I was out playing during recess and I went for a walk around the school.  Most of the kids dont go there, but I saw the red-eyed girl there.  I...I was scared of her.  She looked so strange.  But I remembered seeing how all the other kids treated her...and how they treated me too.  How they called me strange, and a freak, and names.  The girl was just sitting there, by herself, huddled up, and she was reading a book.  I dont even think she noticed me at first.  It was nice out, so I sat down against the wall too.  Not real close though.  And she heard me sitting down and I think I scared her…  She got up and ran off somewhere.  I went to look for her but I couldn't find her anywhere.  She’s good at hiding.  I wish I could do that.

### **Entry  - 9 Sarenith, 4693 AR**
Its been a few weeks, but when I look at the weird girl, Hazel?  She seemed scared of me kinda...She always looks away when she looks at me so quickly, but she looks a little confused too.  I’m starting to think she has pretty eyes.  Every time I see her, she’s almost always reading.  She doesnt talk much in class at all, but i think she’s smart.  I’m gonna try to talk to her.  Maybe we could be friends?  I dont have any friends…

After school I went to the market with Father.  We were buying some fish for dinner and the fish market man was asking father what he had planned for this week’s sermon when an old lady came up and grabbed my hair.  She cut my hair!  Only a little bit, but she looked so happy about it.  I was crying and father said it was part of my blessing from the gods.  People thought my hair had magical powers.  I asked him if it was true and he quietly told me he didnt think so, but it was our duty to be servants to the people of sandpoint for the gods, and my heavenly heritage was a sign of that.  I didn’t say that lady could take my hair!  I didn’t say I wanted to be a servant for her!  (there are tears splattering the page here.)

### **Entry  - 21 Sarenith, 4693 AR**
I found Hazel behind the school again during recess, but this time some little boys had found her and were taking her book and teasing her.  It made me SO mad!!  How could they be so mean!?  I dont remember even wanting to do it, but I remember running at one of the boys who was teasing her and I shoved him down and he fell and hurt his arm a little, and he started to cry and ran off…  the other little boys ran off after him.  Father was mad at me for it, but they deserved it.  I had to say I was sorry, but I didn’t mean it.

Hazel looked scared of me afterwards, but when I talked to her, she seemed to calm down a little.  I asked if I could sit with her for recess and she said yes.  So I sat there and...and i cried a little.  I was just so mad!!  I couldn’t help it.  Hazel sat there with me and i just cried.  Headmaster Gandethus came a little later.  One of the boys told him what had happened, and he saw me crying and asked me what had happened and i told him how it was their fault and how they were teasing Hazel and taking her book and picking on her and how mean they were.  Headmaster said he’d talk to the boys, but that I couldnt do that.  It wasnt right to hurt them.  But they were hurting Hazel?  And they hurt me…

### **Entry  - 4 Abadius, 4697 AR**
(there are what look like tear splotches that have dried on the paper)

I can’t believe they’re still doing this to me.  There was a boy i liked...Runsa Boman.  I’ve liked him for awhile now, but none of the boys ever really paid attention to me or talked to me unless it was to make fun of me.  But Boman said he wanted to talk to me today, and he asked me if I would be his girlfriend and go on a date with him.  I was so excited and happy...I said yes right away, and he asked me if I would go for a walk with him during recess time.  We went for our walk, and I tried to hold his hand, but he pulled his hand away…  And when we got behind the school, there were some other boys there.  They said things like “I can’t believe you actually did it!” and they were laughing, saying they couldnt believe I’d fell for that and that I was a slut…  I just...i started crying and i ran and they were laughing and my face was hot and I was angry...so angry and ashamed…  He never liked me at all...He thought i was a freak.  A monster...I heard him say it when i ran away.  I went and just ran and found Hazel and cried and cried and cried and she held me and cried too.  She’s my only friend in this world…

WHY IS THIS HAPPENING TO ME 

I pray to Desna and Abadar and Erastil and Gozreh and Sarenrae and Shelyn every single night!  I ask them to teach me.  To tell me why.  I beg them!  And none of them answer me.  Why would they make me like this?

### **Entry - 7 Gozran, 4697 AR**
We got a new………. Kid, at the church orphanage.  At first I thought it was an alligator, but father insisted that it was a boy.  A lizardman or something.  More like a lizardboy.  He keeps chewing on the furniture.  Though when he wasn’t being bad he was normally quiet and starring off into space.  Kind of weird.

### **Entry - 12 Erastus, 4697 AR**
I’ve been put by father in charge of teaching Vesh how to read, write, and not chew on things.  It’s annoying, but it means I can spend more time inside instead of going on the walks around town with father getting touched by people, or at school with those boys.  

I talked to the headmaster, and he gave me some advice and books.  For some reason his advice was to explain everything related to food first.  I’m not sure, but he got apple fast when I cut one up and gave him slices for each letter he got right.  He wanted meat though, and I’m not sure how to tell him I can’t get him that.  Father told me meat is only for special moments and we need to abstain otherwise.  And I’m not sure teaching Vesh is a special moment.  But I also noticed that father lets Vesh eat whatever he wants, and I think that’s unfair.  

Why does he get to have so many special moments?

### **Entry - 1 Desnus, 4698 AR**
After a lot of begging father finally started letting Vesh go to school too.  Which is good, there’s only so much I can take of struggling to explain school things to him, and him just repeatedly asking why without getting what I’m saying.  I think he gets why I’m frustrated though, and he’ll normally end the lessons on time.  Or he’s just bored too.  I did find out though that apparently there’s more like him, out in the swamp?  And the fishermen sometimes take him with them so he can visit his people?

If there’s a lot of freaks like him, why does he keep coming back here?  If I was him, I’d stay there.

I wish there was a place for freaks like me out there.

### **Entry - 21 Lamashan, 4698 AR**
I don’t know how I ended up a ring leader for all the weirdos.  I guess it makes sense because I’m the oldest, I am 14, but I have Vesh, Hazel, and now Ameiko following me around after class!

Well, Ameiko is apparently just trying to meet Tsuto, but secretly.  Her dad doesn’t want them to meet since Tsuto is a bastard.  I don’t know why that’s a bad thing though, Mr Lonjiku is mean, and his mom might have met someone she actually loved.  Saying that when I was at dinner with the Avertin’s might not have been the best idea though, Hazel didn’t know what I meant, Aneka and Arika burst out laughing and Arika called me dumb, Mrs Averin got upset and Casp had to step out, he was having trouble breathing and his dad kept hitting his back.

You’d think Casp would be smarter than to choke on his food, being a guard and all.

### **Entry - 20 Kuthona, 4698 AR**
Well, as much as this might get me in trouble if Dad ever found out, Vesh lead Hazel, Ameiko, Tsuto, and I out to the swamp.  We had to hid in fishbarrels though, stowing away onto one of the fishing ships.  It was gross.  But we snuck over the edge to see what Vesh wanted to show us.  And it was just a swamp.

And well, we were just standing there confused as to why he was showing us a swamp, the fishermen of course noticed us.  Thankfully they didn’t turn us over to my dad.  That would’ve been almost as bad as being caught with a boy.

But according to them what Vesh was wanting to show us was where he hatched, not actually his tribe.  Apparently he was exiled or something?  I’m not sure but one of the men apparently had some knowledge of how the lizardfolk thought.  

And they thought Vesh was to smart.  Psh.

But still, he was kicked out because he was different.  So he really is an orphan with no where else to go.

Imma teach him all the prayers to Desna tomorrow.

I think I get it now.  When Father first asked me to work in the cathedral with him, I didn’t want to, but I couldn’t say no either.  I can’t keep up with my homework as much now, but father says it won’t matter too much in the end.  But I think I really do get it now.  I’m a little happier now.  The people of sandpoint come to the cathedral.  They say I’m holy.  They say I’m sent by the divine to help save them, and I listen to their stories and their pains.  And I can understand them.  I’ve felt that pain too.  The gods did bless me.  They have chosen me to serve them, and they knew that while it would be hard, I could do it.  That's why they gave me all these hard things.  They knew the people would need me.  I dont get to see Hazel as much anymore.  She’s busy with her schoolwork and she says she’s even studying magic now, and that Headmaster Gandethus promised to teach her.  I miss her, but I still get to see her sometimes.  She’s like my sister.

### **Entry  - 15 Abadius, 4701 AR**
I was working at the cathedral today, Delek Viskanta came by again today.  He comes by a lot now.  He always seems happy to see me.  It makes me happy to see him.  He’s so nice to me.  He even brought a flower today, a white lily.  He said it reminded him of me, and my beautiful hair.  I think he likes me.  I like him.  But Father won't like it.  Father says I can’t have a boyfriend, that boys only want one thing and that I have to remain pure so I can serve the gods.  But why would the gods bring Delek to me then?

### **Entry - 21 Calistril, 4701 AR**
I went on a date with Delek!  I was so excited!!  He’s so nice and sweet.  He tells me my hair is beautiful and how much he loves my purple eyes, like he’s looking up at the heavens themselves.  We had to go somewhere private, but Delek said he found these secret tunnels under the town when he was a child, and we could be alone there without anybody finding us.  I dont care that we’re in tunnels underground.  It’s not scary or bad if I’m with him, and the way he held me and made love to me.  I never felt so happy before.

### **Entry  - 3 Gozran, 4701 AR**
It’s been about a month and a half since Delek and I started dating.  I dont get to see him too often, but when we can we go to the tunnels and he makes love to me and holds me like i’ve never been loved before...but I havent had my period this month…  I’m late by two weeks.  I’m worried.  I think I’m pregnant…  I know I’m young but Delek and I love each other.  If I dont get my period next month, I’ll have to tell him and we’ll have to either tell Father or run away together.

### **Entry  - 1 Sarenith, 4702 AR**
(This entry is written in a very harsh, angry scrawl.  Some parts are hard to read because they’ve been written over with things like “NONE OF THEM EVER LOVED ME”)

IT WAS ALL A LIE!!! HE NEVER LOVED ME NEITHER OF THEM DID!!  FATHER NEVER LOVED ME!  DELEK NEVER LOVED ME!!  I TOLD HIM I WAS PREGNANT!  I THOUGHT HE WOULD BE HAPPY BUT I WAS WRONG  HE CALLED ME A SLUT!  A WHORE!   HE SAID HE NEVER LOVED ME AND HE WAS LEAVING AND IT WAS MY PROBLEM!!  

I WENT HOME AND PRAYED AND PRAYED AND PRAYED AND FATHER CAME AND ASKED ME WHAT WAS WRONG AND...AND I TOLD HIM AND I WENT TO HUG HIM HIM AND JUST CRY...AND...AND...HE SLAPPED ME…

HE CALLED ME A COMMON HARLOT AND A SLUT AND TOLD ME I WAS SUPPOSED TO REMAIN PURE SO I COULD JOIN A COVENANT AND I SHOULD BE ASHAMED AND HE DRAGGED ME TO MY ROOM AND LOCKED ME INSIDE AND TOLD ME I COULDNT LEAVE AND HAD BETTER PRAY AND ASK FOR FORGIVENESS I DONT UNDERSTAND WHY WOULD THE GODS DO THIS TO ME

### **Entry  - 15 Sarenith, 4702**
Its been two weeks and father still wont let me leave my room.  He even wont let me into just the cathedral…  He says I should be ashamed and that I have to pray and study…. WHY DID THIS HAPPEN TO ME WHY CAN’T I JUST BE HAPPY

          Vesh
          Ameiko

I GET IT NOW I REALLY GET IT NOW I PRAYED AND PRAYED AND PRAYED THE WHOLE TIME AND NONE OF THEM ANSWERED ME I ASKED DESNA SO MANY TIMES TO HELP ME AND SHE DIDNT ANSWER ME

My baby was born early...my baby...The nursemaids tried to hide it from me.  They wouldnt let me see it, but i could tell.  I SAW THE TRUTH MY BABY WAS A MONSTER!!! A FIEND!!! THEY TOOK MY BABY FROM ME AND GOT RID OF IT.  I COULDNT STAND IT!!

I woke up 3 weeks later and they said father said I had been in a coma.  He told me to pray to the gods and ask for forgiveness, and that he would be sending me to the nuns next week…  

IDIOT

I prayed to desna...and I heard an answer, but it wasnt desna.  It was the mother...MY MOTHER

She told me what to do...lock his door, put the bookcase in front of it, and set the cathedral on fire

I ran away to Magnimar. I think Delek was going there...I’m going to find him.  And i’m going to make him pay!!  Mother promised me so much...she’s shown me the truth, the reality of life.  She’s the mother of monsters.  She gave birth to monsters, to us.  To ALL OF US  We’re all monsters inside, and i’m she told me I could get rid of my celestial taint and finally become whole and true.  I’m going to find Delek AND I’M GOING TO KILL HIM

### **Entry  - 25 Rova, 4702**
I snuck aboard a ship heading to Magnimar, doing the same thing of hiding inside a fish barrel like we had done in the past.  It was easy to do while the town was panicking and running around like cocks with their heads cut off, and while I had to wait a while for the ship to depart, no one checked anything.  I ate the fish in that barrel throughout the trip, and drank what water flowed in from the rain.

I didn't get out for the whole trip, not until I could hear the men's voices talking and things being moved.  During a moment of silence I got out and dove into the bay, the way Vesh taught me, and swam to the docks.  From there though, I didn't have much choice but to wander around, soaked, and ask around if anyone had seen someone like Delek.  nothing though, this town is to big.  So I stayed at some seedy in to stretch what money I could from what I stole from the churches coffers, and the money I took from the men that tried to break into my room that first night.

### **Entry  - 27 Rova, 4702**
A man met with me, who said that his leader wanted to speak to a fellow worshipper of mother.  it felt like such a sign I went along with it.  That's how I met X and the judge.  While the judge talked in big grandiose words about Father Skinsaw, X was more to the point, all smiles and silk, but I knew there was more to her than there was to the judge.  she was more like me, and she knew mother too.  They told me they would help me find Delek, and so much more.

### **Entry  - 1 Lamashan, 4702**
They made me wait an extra day, but only so that it would be the first day of mothers month to honor her, but I was finally able to find Delek.  He had been had a rich whore house, amusingly.  He had been fucking a white haired whore.  I suppose he has a type.

X laughed hard when she saw that I had carved both of them up.  It's a good thing she had cast a silence, or else we certainly would've been caught.  She said it was unfornate that Delek was lustful instead of greedy, though I'm not sure what that has anything to do with it.  She gave me a seven pointed star necklace, and told me to wear it always, and that it would lead me to more allies.

She took me back to the judge and his cult, and we celebrated.  But I found myself craving more.  the judge noticed this, though I'm sure X already knew.  He offers to help me, though he told me to be honest with what I want.

I want...... to kill that old woman that took my hair.  I want to kill that boy that always crushed my favorite flower at the academy.  I want to kill Delek's family who spawned such a horrible person, I want Runsa, I want to kill Abigail, I want to kill Lonjiku, I want to kill so many of those fuckers, those who stood by, those who took, every single one that went to those services and took what that moron Tobyn said seriously.

I want to kill sandpoint.

X smiled and rubbed my shoulders and said I would, I just needed help.  I need to be stronger.

They're going to help me.

### **Entry  - 5 Sarenith, 4703**
My arms are tired.  I've been doing my best to learn those smaller blades the cult likes, or the spear that X likes, but they just don't do it for me.  I can't move my arms like that.  My new sword though feels right, it's just so heavy though.

I go got it a few days ago.  I did see a man, maybe a mercenary? carrying a very large sword.  He spends a lot of money on different things, and plays lots of cards to get more.  I haven't seen him do many jobs though.  The sword is beautiful though.

With X's help we lure him to a room and gut him.  She puts some mark on him first.  I don't pay to much attention to that though, more distracted with the very sharp sword I now have.

my dreams have been acting up again.

### **Entry  - 11 Desnus, 4705**
I FOUND YOU.

### **Entry  - 13 Neth, 4705**
My dreams have been of sandpoint.  of that cave delek and I met.   I visited where I threw his body.  A little cove.  I can't see his skeleton anymore.  It's flesh had been stripped by fish not long after I threw it there, but I liked to come see it sometimes.  I liked to ask it what we should've named our child.  If it was a boy or girl.  Something chelish.  I don't like Varisians.  Maybe chestnut for a girl?  kind of like hazel.  for a boy though...........  that bitch had said it had been a monster, while I thrashed and they took them away.  If it was a monster, and a boy, maybe something lizardfolk.  something stupid, like Ves.

### **Entry  - 14 Abadius, 4706**
X said I should follow my dreams.  They want me to go back to that cave, to the bricked up tunnel.  I go back to the cove.

I don't feel anything for it.

Getting a ship back is easy.  I'll need to be careful not to be noticed.

### **Entry  - 31 Abadius, 4706**
Ameiko has a tavern near the docks.  Hazel still works at the bakery.  I didn't see Casp anywhere.  Vesh is working on building a new church.

I don't feel anything for it.

### **Entry  - 1 Calistril, 4706**
I got to the cave today, and bashed down the wall.  It was easier than I expected.

I found a whole catacombs there.  a temple to mother.

and Erylium.

she's had dreams about me too.  we talked about a lot.  She showed me the runewell.  told me about our god, about what this place is.  And about what we should do next.  I asked her to teach me everything she can.  She agreed.

### **Entry  - 27 Gozran, 4707**
This will probably be my last entry.  I'll be leaving the book here, as the last part of my past.  The plan is mostly ready now.  I have Tsuto wrapped around my finger, and with the additional help of Bruthazmus to track down the goblins, Lyrie to help with the rituals, and Orik to handle the general bodyguard duties, we'll be heading to Thistletop soon to get the allegiance of those goblins and figure out what my new dreams mean.  Once we have those goblins, we'll get the other four tribes.  After that I'll let Tsuto and the others figure out the plan.  As long as Sandpoint burns it doesn't matter.  Getting Tobyn's bones first will at least accelerate my own transformation, but we need a full pyre for true rebirth.

If there's anything I regret at this point....... It's that I wasn't born a demon in the first place.

(There is a small note written in the back of the journal.  Looks like this part is older than the more recent entries, though there is no date.)

[NHVA]
Nualia
Hazel
Vesh
Ameiko

Put the first letter of each name together to form NHVA.
That is our secret name.
Even if we get married and give birth... Even if we are separated, the fact that we are friends will never change.
Let us stop fighting.
Let us stop hating.
Let us pray to the gods that we might live a good life―
Yes, that's right.
Of course, that never became true.
It never became true.
Ah... but there was something else that happened.
Maybe at the time of our deaths, we'll be together again.
