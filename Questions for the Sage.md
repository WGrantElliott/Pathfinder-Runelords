## Questions for the Sage
1. What does he know about Alzanist? What about the book with a seven pointed star?

2. Why are there alters to wrath in Sandpoint?

3. What if any associations are there between thassalonian rune lords and gods? Alzanist created the first sinspawns and Lamashtu is the goddess of misshapen and malformed creatures. There are altars to thassalonian rune lords and also rooms with thassalonian runes, but the goblin said he would eat our face for lamashtu.

4. Ask if he knows Abyssal, discuss the books we found.

5. There is an entry that says it's unfortunate that Delek was lustful instead of greedy, could they be using greedy people for something? Could this relate to Thassalonian greed or something for a transmutation spell/rune? Could it relate to the old light?

6. See if he has any idea about the alter and the liquid swirling in it? Nualia's journal mentions a runewell, I should make an arcana check to see if I know what that is.

7. "I got to the cave today, and bashed down the wall.  It was easier than I expected. and Erylium. she's had dreams about me too.  we talked about a lot.  She showed me the runewell.  told me about our god, about what this place is.  And about what we should do next." Who's Erylium? Is this the "she" that has also had dreams about Nualia? I'm thinking the thassalonian rune lords have some connection to gods considering someone showed nualia a runewell and explained how a god related to all of it
