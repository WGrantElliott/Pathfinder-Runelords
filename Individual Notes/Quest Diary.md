## Quest Diary
### **Session One: Swallowtail Festival**
Our heroes begin their tale in the town of Sandpoint during the lively Swallowtail Festival. The party consists of:

Hazel, daughter of a local baker

Vesh, a Lizardfolk serving part-time as an acolyte at the local cathedral

Ryvven and Xona, an elf and a drow adventurer, both passing through town seeking answers and finding themselves caught up in the festivities

The group partakes in various celebrations:
Hazel competes in Guildmaster Aesrick Battlehorn’s catapult game; Vesh makes several valiant attempts at the Hagfish Challenge; Xona has a sexual awakening thanks to Ameiko Kaijitsu; and Ryvven begins to question his orientation after consistently failing to shoot straight—though, to be fair, that may have been more joke than truth.

As the final event—the consecration of the new cathedral—approaches, the town is suddenly attacked by goblins, who surge forth both from the gates and from within Sandpoint itself. Chaos erupts, but Hazel first ensures the safety of her sisters, Aneka and Arika, before joining the others in the defense of the town.

The party distinguishes themselves in the fight, notably saving a nobleman named Aldern Foxglove, who is the first of many to praise their bravery. While the town guard and even local townsfolk fought admirably, it was the group of four who became the center of attention—having defended the heart of the festival at the very foot of the cathedral. Thanks to their efforts, none of the civilians near them perished.

The following day, the party meets with Sheriff Belor Hemlock and Father Abstalar Zantus, who reveal a troubling detail: during the attack, someone broke into one of the cathedral’s crypts—specifically the resting place of Father Ezakien Tobyn, the former high priest of Abadar, who died in the fire that destroyed the old church. That same fire also claimed the lives of his adopted daughter Nualia Tobyn, a young Aasimar girl once regarded as the most beautiful girl in town, and two other acolytes—Buda Innun and Yeric Entig.

Investigating the crypt, the party discovers it had indeed been disturbed—and are forced into combat with two skeletons, which they quickly dispatch.

### **Session Two: Local Heroes**
Following the events of the previous day, the party investigates the crypt further after slaying the skeletons. They find that only Father Tobyn’s bones have been taken—the other interred bodies left untouched. Despite this, Father Zantus has Vesh assist in opening and then reconsecrating the three remaining coffins. Two contain what appear to be the remains of grown men, wrapped in linen. The third is notably smaller—wrapped so tightly and thickly that it resembles a large egg sealed inside an adult-sized coffin.

Outside, the others scour the cathedral grounds. Among the tracks left behind are mostly goblin footprints—but one appears to be from a grown man, though it’s inconclusive. With the investigation complete, the party reseals the crypt without issue.

Over the next few days, the party begins to gain notoriety in Sandpoint for their heroics.

Aldern Foxglove returns to town, inviting the group on a boar hunt and presenting them with a reward in gold. While he only rents two horses for the party, he buys a personal steed for Hazel as a gift. The boar hunt leads them into the Tickwood, where they do manage to find a boar—but the encounter takes a turn when it gores Vesh in the neck with its tusks, nearly killing him. He survives, but the mood is understandably dampened by the close call.

Upon returning to Sandpoint, the party heads to the Rusty Dragon Inn, where Aldern and Xona are staying, to prepare for a celebratory feast.

Ameiko Kaijitsu begins prepping the slain boar in the kitchen.

Hazel rushes off to her family bakery to fetch fresh bread and invite her sisters. Aldern thanks her and promises to order blackberries from Korvosa for the bakery.

Meanwhile, the others disperse for the evening, and Ryvven has a noteworthy encounter.

He meets Shayliss Vinder, daughter of Ven Vinder, the owner of the local general store. With her older sister Katrine the current focus of town gossip due to an affair with the sawmill manager, Shayliss decides to stir up her own scandal. She seduces Ryvven, and they enjoy a brief romantic interlude—until her father unexpectedly returns. Ryvven barely escapes with his clothes, and there's a real chance Ven may remember his face.

(For what it’s worth, this marks the third time an elf has caused trouble and run off in Sandpoint. A trend is forming.)

Later that evening, as the party settles into the Rusty Dragon for the feast, Ameiko is in the kitchen finishing preparations when her father, Lonjiku Kaijitsu, arrives unannounced. Looking ill-tempered and worse for wear, he demands to speak with his daughter. Upon seeing the party, he begins harassing them with thinly veiled contempt. Ameiko emerges shortly after, and the two begin arguing in Minkaian. When Lonjiku attempts to grab her by the hair, Ameiko beans him on the head with a soup ladle, sending him storming out.

His parting words are sharp and cold:

“You’re as dead to me as your mother.”

Despite the unpleasant scene, the party and patrons do their best to enjoy the night. Aldern mentions that he’ll soon be returning to his estate south of town.

The next morning, Sheriff Belor Hemlock sends word, requesting a meeting between the party and a local ranger to discuss the growing goblin threat.

### **Session Three: The Glassworks**
The party starts off going to the church, where they see the finishing touches being done on the statues and other such woodwork in the church being put up.  Not far away, Sheriff Hemlock and the ranger [[Shalelu Andosana]].  She tells them that the five goblin tribes local to the area have started working together for some reason, at least as far as attacking Sandpoint together.  She plans to go check out some of the other goblin locations where they're known to live, like Shank’s Wood, Brinestump, Mosswood, or Devil’s Platter.  Hemlock himself plans to head to Magnimar soon to request reinforcements, and asks the party if they'll stay around the town to act as reinforcements in case something happens before he's back.

For the rest of the day, not much really happens.  The next morning however, when the party is meeting with Aldern for breakfast at the Rusty Dragon, one of Ameiko's employees talks to them.

Her name is [[Bethana Corwin]], and she informs them her employer has gone missing, handing them a note from Ameiko's brother Tsuto, requesting she meet him the night before.  Ameiko never came back.

So, with the potential danger in mind, they head out to the Glassworks to see if they're there.  While the doors are locked and all the windows covered on the inside, there is smoke coming from the chimneys, but they hear voices inside, and Vesh, climbing onto the roof, finds himself looking down on goblins from the glass panels up there.  Alerting the group, they move around to one of the side doors, and break in.

Easily slaughtering all the goblins except one, they discover that all the staff including Lonjiku Kaijitsu, Ameiko's father, were dead.  Lonjiku himself having the 'honor' of being turned into a glass covered statue.  While the rest of the party finished up the goblins though, Hazel chased one down that fled downstairs, where in a horror movie scene Freddy Kruger style had it shitting it's pants until Tsuto came out of his room.

He was confused to see Hazel there, Hazel was confused as well, but after he insisted Ameiko was alright and showed her to Hazel, and mentioned he was there working for Nualia, he offered to take her to see her, which she agreed.  They went down a smugglers tunnel and through a door, which Tsuto then sealed, leaving Vesh trapped in the tunnel unable to figure out where Hazel went.

### **Session Four: Revelations**
This time we start with Hazel and Tsuto in a row boat, awkwardly paddling along the coast, heading to the [[Nettlewood]].  Tsuto and her don't really talk to much, until they finally land.  Tsuto says they have to travel on foot, since the shore near the camp is unsafe.  Traveling into the woods doesn't take to long, though they quickly notice the smell of decay and lots of birds like ravens, crows, vultures in the trees around them.  Which of course leads to them getting attacked by what's known as a Carrionstorm.

While they are able to punch and strike the birds fairly easily, there are close to almost a thousand corpse birds in this swarm which surrounds them like a tornado of rotten feathers, when another arrives.

Looking like Alucard, he releases a ray of empowering sunlight that reduces the birds to ash.  He introduces himself as [[Allans Zartakov]], a cleric of Sarenrae, who was journeying out here to visit the new church when he noticed the presence of these undead.  Tsuto, not one for subtly, decides he's going to go ahead and kill this priest right there and now so he can't interfere with their plans.

He gets his shit kicked in.

They tie him up, admittedly rather poorly, though he wasn't going to try to run with them being ready to beat him up again, and they start walking back to sandpoint.

They don't get very far before their questions on the road take turn to shit talking, with Tsuto revealing he works for Nualia to destroy sandpoint, out of Nualia's desire for revenge and to be cleansed.  He also reveals she's the one that set the fire that killed Tobyn and two others, and that was because she had been left by Delek pregnant, Tobyn locked her up, and then she gave birth to a monster.  Allans gives him the chance to fight for his freedom, Tsuto loses badly and lies bleeding out, and while they first leave him to his fate, Hazel goes back after thinking about it and rips his throat out.
With the group still at the glassworks, they rescue Ameiko and then proceed to wander in the dark tunnel with no light for a while.  Eventually after slapping flint and steel together to make sparks for them to see, Xona finds incense in her bag she lights up, giving them five real life minutes of light.

Thank god for Ameiko as she finds the secret door to the cave the goblins used to get into the city.  It also had two other tunnels, one of which ended in rubble, and the other which was partially bricked up.  The group decided to head back though, except Vesh who heard something and decided to wait and see what it was.

From the bricked up tunnel, a creature emerged.  Six and a half feet tall, it looked like a horribly deformed human.  Pale emaciated flesh, with unnaturally long arms that ended in two talon tipped fingers and a thumb, and reversed legs like those of a dog.  It's head was elongated, with a pair of slits for a nose, bulging red eyes, and it's lower jaw split at the chin into pedipalps that each ended in tiny three fingered hands.

Vesh turned and fled, yelling at the others to go, and in the dark tunnel rammed straight into Ryvven, leading to them both falling down, but Xona and Ameiko booked it right out of the glassworks, yelling about goblins until they got to the garrison building, getting the attention of the guards who came out to meet them.  Hemlock, who was still there as there was a storm that delayed the ship to Magnimar, joined them to go check out the tunnels while Ameiko was taken to the church.

They walked and talked, the party catching Hemlock up, his men actually using lanterns as they descended into the tunnel.  But when they arrived in the cave, there was only one tunnel that lead out of there, the one with rubble at the end.  Telling two of his men to stay there on watch, and planning to set up a rotating watch until they could block this cave up permanently, they head back to check out the rest of the glassworks.

The trio decides to go and inform Hazel's parents at this point, with them rolling a nat 1 on life and get a door slammed in their face at their explanation of "well, we don't know how but we lost her".

After that, they head to the church.  Xona fumbling some more at social interaction, though it does come out that they never found a body of Nualia's to bury.  Instead there is something else buried in her casket in the crypt.
