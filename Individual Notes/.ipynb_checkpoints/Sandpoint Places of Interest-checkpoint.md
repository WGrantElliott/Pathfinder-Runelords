## Sandpoint Places of Interest
### **8 Sage - Discuss Theories**
Brodert has been studying ancient Thassilonian ruins for the past several years and has recently become obsessed with the Old Light. No one believes his theories that the tower was once a war machine capable of spewing fire to a range of more than a mile.

### **12 Savah’s Armory - GO HERE - Weapons and Shit**
Savah’s shop sells all manner of weapons and armor, including several masterwork items and exotic weapons like a spiked chain, a dozen masterwork shuriken, and a +1 repeating crossbow with a darkwood and ivory stock that bears the name “Vansaya.” She’s not sure what the name means—she bought the weapon from an adventurer on the way to Riddleport a year ago, and its high price and complexity have ensured its semi-permanent stay in her shop.

### **41 Sandpoint Boutique - Look at weapons, books, and tools**
This large boutique and shop sells all manner of clothing, weapons, toys, artwork, books, and tools imported from throughout the world, although most of the wares here are Varisian in nature.

### **4 The Way North - Maps are always good**
Maps of local regions, from the immediate vicinity up to the whole of Varisia and the Storval Plateau, can be purchased from him for prices ranging from 5 gp to 100 gp, depending on the size and level of detail. When not here crafting copies of old maps, Veznutt can usually be found arguing over history with his best friend Ilsoari at Turandarok Academy (area 27).

### **19 House of Blue Stones - Good to just see if I can get in**
Sabyl maintains a large collection of old books and scrolls in the basement chambers below. She opens both the meditation floor and her library to fellow worshipers, but others must convince her of their good intentions with a successful DC 25 Diplomacy check before she’ll let them in. Use of Sabyl’s library grants a +4 bonus on Knowledge (history) and Knowledge (the planes) checks.

### **27 Turandarok Academy - Basement could be interesting and help us learn something**
The town agreed, and today, the rooms below the Academy are almost a museum of the strange things and trophies Ilsoari has collected over his years. He keeps these chambers locked. Although the contents are much less sinister (Ilsoari is all too happy to show off his collection of exotic weapons, strange maps, and monster trophies to anyone who asks nicely), the old wizard does nothing to dissuade the children’s tales.

### **9 Locksmith - Learn lock picking - Owner seems to hate thieves so he might not teach lock picking to a random**
A flamboyant dwarf named Volioker Briskalberd (LG male dwarf rogue 2/expert 3) has owned and operated Sandpoint’s locksmith business since the town’s founding. Most of the town’s locks were built by Volioker. 

### **28 Madame Mvashti’s House - Just seems interesting**
Although from outside this appears to be an ancient, decrepit manor house with several rooms, only one person lives in this old building—ancient and mysterious Niska Mvashti (N female venerable human druid 3/sorcerer 4/mystic theurge 1). Old even when Sandpoint was founded decades ago, Madame Mvashti (as she prefers to be called) is a Varisian historian and seer, part of a long tradition of oracles in her family. 

### **30 Vernah’s Fine Clothing - Kind of just seems interesting**
The only daughter of a kindly woman named Vernah, Rynshinn never knew her father, Iremiel, only that he was killed by goblins less than a week after she was born. At the time, Vernah’s tempestuous affair with the mysterious elven bard was the talk of the town. Every year on the anniversary of Rynshinn’s birth, a small package of elven coins, medicine, and toys mysteriously appeared somewhere in the upper floors of this building. 
She’s looking into opening a shop in Magnimar as well, but has yet to find a partner there whom she trusts.

### **13 Risa’s Place - Good for lore**
Known as much for Risa’s tales of ancient legends and myths as for its spiced potatoes and cider, this tavern is a favorite of the locals if only because its out-of-the-way location ensures strangers rarely come by.

### **16 The Pillbug’s Pantry - Good place to pick up potions?**
Nestled at the base of a cliff and tucked between several old tenements, nothing but a painting of a pillbug perched on a mushroom indicates this building is anything more than yet another home. The proprietor of this establishment is a short, rotund man named Aliver “Pillbug” Podiker (LE male human alchemist 5), an accomplished herbalist, gardener, and secret poisoner. 

### **22 The Curious Goblin - Pricey wares might have something good**

### **25 Sandpoint Lumber Mill - Pick up material to make arrows**

### **29 Grocer’s Hall - Maybe a good place to pick up vegetarian rations**

### **35 Sandpoint Market - Maybe a good place to pick up vegetarian rations**
