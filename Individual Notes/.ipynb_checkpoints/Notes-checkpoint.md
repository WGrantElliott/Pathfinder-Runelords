	&emsp;&emsp;Old man white beard<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;Pre eathfall Thassalonian<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;Theory: Tower was very capabale<br>
		&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Olden days most scholars agree<br>
		&emsp;&emsp;Defensive Position<br>
			&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Spew fire more than a mile<br>
		&emsp;&emsp;Youth<br>
		&emsp;&emsp;Theming of thassolanian<br>
			&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;all run by wizard<br>
		&emsp;&emsp;Somewhere in the ruins there<br>

Mayor views it as the tourist attraction<br>

Feint conjuration magic around the shrine<br><br>
	&emsp;&emsp;Brodart has sensed it as well<br>
		&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;It presents a twist to evocation spells<br>
		&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Conjuration could be tied to other functions<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;Meditate around other structures try and find other ruins<br>
		&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Detect Magic<br><br>
		
Caught Goblins said they had simple orders "Kill everyone and burn the place down"<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;Part of Ulongshakes<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;Leader was on a secret mission to the towns graveyard<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;Crypt was probably where they went since it was open<br>
		&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Crypt contained the 3 bodies from the fire<br><br>
		
Only 1 crypt is open and the body is missing<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;Eziken previous priest was in the crypt<br>
		&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Vesh was partly raised by him<br>
		&emsp;&emsp;Hazel knew him<br>
		&emsp;&emsp;He's big in raising the orphans<br>
			&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Speak to the orphans about Eziken<br>
		&emsp;&emsp;Strict and revered the gods<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;Goblins here came from the east<br>
		&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;There were other goblins that came from the north and some were already in the city<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;Bones have some sort of power<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;Vesh starts opening the unopened casks so the priest can reconsecrate<br><br>

Merchant(Foxglove) has money for the horses but he's asking for rental horses<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;Trying to haggle everyone else but Hazels horse<br><br>

I had sex with Shayliss<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;Her dad came down and found me<br>
		&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Said never to come back to the General Store<br>
Shayliss<br>
Katyrynn (Shayliss Sister)<br><br>

5 goblin tribes around according to Shalelu Andosana<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;all five were involved in the raid<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;forest goblins have more browns/green<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;devils hills goblin has feathers<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;swamp goblins has lizard tooth and scale leather<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;Long shanks killed a bunch of them<br>
		&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;might have been us or some other group<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;They don’t usually get along unless they have big plans<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;Goblin Heros<br>
		&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;big gugmut<br>
		&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;kuruko<br>
		&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;ripnugget<br>
		&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Bruthomus (Maybe Bruthazmus) is a bug bear ranger who interacts with the tribes by trading<br><br>

Divination from the Cyphergrate<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;Theories that there are a number of ruins carved over the length of it<br>
		&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Ruins are thessolonian ruins but they seem to be kind of random<br>
			&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Not really like how thassalonian is written<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;Actually a full circle and not an arch<br>
		&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;It’s just partially buried underground<br>
		&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;No attempts to dig because the city was built around it<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Refineries in the town use highly explosive fuel source<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The ruin magic that thassolonian uses does not have ruins for divination<br>
		&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;They spurned divination believing it to be the work of oracle<br>
Sage hasn’t been to cypher gate <br><br>
Thassalon was ruled by wizards, a meritocracy<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;Much disparity that could have been caused by corruption<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;Their magic worked differently, they used runes where they could reach different affects they wanted by the different runes<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;They could inscribe runes on things and empower items<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;If Thassolonians used ruins from one school, they could not use other schools of magic<br><br>
	&emsp;&emsp;1st symbol from left - Envy - abjuration<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;2nd			- Gluttony - Necromancy<br> 
	&emsp;&emsp;3rd			- Greed - Transmutation<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;4th			- Lust - Enchantment<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;5th			- Pride<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;6th			- Sloth - Conjuration<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;7th			- Wrath - Evocation<br><br>
	&emsp;&emsp;It is not known why exactly Thassolonia fell<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;There is no known Thassolonian site associated with Pride<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;The old light is associated with transmutation which is greed<br><br>
	
We rescued Amiko from the glass factory<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;When we got there her father was had been encased in glass<br><br>
	
We killed the goblins and continued downstairs<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;When we got there Hazel and Tsuto were gone<br><br>

We continued down a tunnel where vesh had smelled hazel however we came upon a stone rock<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;We looked around and Vesh found a way to pull back the stone<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;We walked out into a cove with bedrolls that were probably used by the goblins, we saw a brick wall which we heard scraping coming from<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;We decided to run, vesh stayed back and caught a glimpse, but nobody else saw it<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;When we got out, Xona took Amiko back to the garrison to get some guards<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;We went back down the tunnel but the bricks were gone and replaced with a stone wall<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;We looked down the other tunnel but it led to a cave in<br><br>

We agreed to check on this basement place during the next night and day<br>
We went back to town and told Hazels parents that she was missing (they did not take it well)<br>
Amiko was transferred to the sanctuary so we went and met her there<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;Shalelu said she would stay in town, but apoparently she did not<br><br>

Vantis (Zantis?) - Shaman<br>
Vasc - Old Man - Three leg<br>
Tobin - Old Shaman<br>
Aldermen - Guy who likes hazel<br>
Orkegg - Big Green Skin - Sandpoint Deputy<br>
Allans Zartavescu - Son of Zartav - New Party Member<br>
Quinck - Sage guy<br>
We ask Vantis to exhume Nualias Casket<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;Vantis agrees<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;Egg shaped wrapping in the casket<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;I unwrapped it, there is a deformed reptilian baby skeleton<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;Snake like<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;Nualias child<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;Dalik got Nualia pregnant<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;She told him then went and confessed to Tobin who imprisoned here<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;Tobin said it was for religious fasting and prayers but it was a punishment<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;She gave premature birth which had to get a C-section<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;The midwife took the child and cast the supposedly dead child in a fire	Nualia went into a coma<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;Then the fire happened 2-3 weeks later<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;Nualias body was never found<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;Tobin was a mean man<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;We reconsecrated the grave<br>
Allans Zartavescu<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;Medium Armor with 3 scars<br>
Allans ran into Hazel and Tsuto in a forest while they were being attacked by carrion storms<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;Tsuto was demeaning Hazel so Allans struck him down and took his things then Hazel went back and dealt the final blow<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;Nualiah started worshipping Lamashtu<br>
Hazel got back and showed us Tsuto’s journal<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;We let her know that we checked Nualias casket<br>
Guards had 4 hour shifts patrolling the glass factory<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;It’s been 5 hours since the last shift came through	It seems like the guards aren’t the best, when they change shifts the guards stationed in the tunnel come up to the surface, then the guards on the surface go down into the tunnels<br>
We make our way into the tunnels under the glasswork factory<br><br>
Sinspawns<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;Artificial lifeforms that spawn from sins<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;Thessalonians Homunculi<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;Boogyman for why you don’t explore ruins<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;Somehow manage to capture souls and then encase them in corrupted flesh	This city is built on the city of wrath/greed<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;Red liquid comes pouring out when he dies<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;Basically like a balloon popping<br>
Pissed off woman (Alzanist rune lord of wrath)<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;headress of hooks and blades<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;book with seven pointed star<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;Ransor specialty pike<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;Queen of baccaran<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;Used to be where the rizzan gulf is	According to the old man Alzana made the original sinspawns<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;Other lords created their copy of sinspawns<br><br>
	
Altar black marble<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;Basin is filled with dirty water<br>
		&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The water has something seperate in it, almost like oil and water, the liquid is swirling in what looks to be a stationary bowl<br>
		&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;It smells like a disgusting rotten sweetness of fruit<br>
			&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Almost like wondering if it is too bad to taste<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;Hazel examines the altar and can't really make out modifiers, engravings are faded. Rocks have shapes, swirls, and carvings<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;Not really sure what god it is associated to but it's pretty clear it's not aligned to a good god considering it's located below ground in a dark cave<br>
		&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;It might make sense if it was associated with the lord of wrath considering we've already run into a statue for the lord of wrath<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;There is a magical presence. Auras are strong but I was not able to discern the magic used.<br>
		&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;1 for the alter<br>
		&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;1 for the liquid<br>
		&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Chicken and egg question<br>
			&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;One created the second effect<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;Magic is old but still here which means it is probably very powerful<br><br>

Door is locked<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;Medusa and Chimera on either side of the door<br>
		&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The two monsters on display are monsters that were changed into their current forms<br><br>
		
Continuing up we come into a prison room<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;3 sinthspawns with newer weapons in pretty good condition<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;We kept going and ran into an archaic torture room<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;Then 3 doors strange symbol seven pointed star<br>
		&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Same symbol Alzanist had<br>
		&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Something rampaged through here<br>
		&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Opening door 1, there is a normal body but it has 3 very brittle arms,<br>
		&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Opening door 2, there are skeletal remains of a humanoid body but the head is extremely enlarged<br>
		&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Opening door 3, another humanoid but with normal head, ribcage goes down to it's pelvis<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;We run into koruvus (He said he would eat our face for lamashtu)<br><br>

We cannot go into the generaal store again<br><br>

Went to bottled solutions to get potions<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;Corked bottles safest to buy<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;Bought 4 minor healing potions<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;Bought 1 inflict wounds<br><br>
	
A long time ago a vampire was terrorizing the mountains around ustalav<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;Allans was born from that terror<br><br>

Objects floating in room<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;Walls plated in sheets of red metal that ripple with electrticty that coalesce into strange words or runes<br>
		&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Runes spell out a spell of levitation<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;wand of shocking grasp (28 charges)<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;scroll of burning hands<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;dead raven<br>
		&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Full of maggots<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;bottle of wine<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;2 books<br>
		&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;In the pages of one of the books, a key floats out<br>
		&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;1st book - Abyssal - Lamashtu<br>
			&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The book is a heavy, ancient tome, its cover bound in dark, cracked leather that seems to writhe faintly under torchlight, embossed with jagged Abyssal runes that pulse with an unsettling crimson glow. The edges of the pages are uneven, stained with age and use, yet the book remains eerily intact, as if preserved by some unholy force. Inside, the parchment is thick and rough, each page filled with meticulous, blood-red script that twists into disturbing patterns. Vivid woodcut illustrations of grotesque creatures and their brutal acts of slaughter punctuate the text, their details almost too lifelike, as if the monsters might claw their way off the page.<br><br>
		&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;2nd book - Common - Nualia's Journal<br>
			&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;We had to go somewhere private, but Delek said he found these secret tunnels under the town when he was a child, and we could be alone there without anybody finding us.<br><br>
			&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;She told me what to do...lock his door, put the bookcase in front of it, and set the cathedral on fire<br><br>
			&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Entry  - 21 Rova, 4702<br>
				&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;This is when the great unpleasantness occurred<br><br>
			&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Entry  - 27 Rova, 4702 (In Magnimar)<br>
			&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;A man met with me, who said that his leader wanted to speak to a fellow worshipper of mother.  it felt like such a sign I went along with it.  That's how I met X and the judge.  While the judge talked in big grandiose words about Father Skinsaw, X was more to the point, all smiles and silk, but I knew there was more to her than there was to the judge.  she was more like me, and she knew mother too.  They told me they would help me find Delek, and so much more.<br><br>
			&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Entry  - 1 Lamashan, 4702<br>
			&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;X laughed hard when she saw that I had carved both of them up.  It's a good thing she had cast a silence, or else we certainly would've been caught.  She said it was unfornate that Delek was lustful instead of greedy, though I'm not sure what that has anything to do with it.  She gave me a seven pointed star necklace, and told me to wear it always, and that it would lead me to more allies.<br><br>
			&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;She took me back to the judge and his cult, and we celebrated.  But I found myself craving more. <br><br>
			&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I want...... to kill that old woman that took my hair.  I want to kill that boy that always crushed my favorite flower at the academy.  I want to kill Delek's family who spawned such a horrible person, I want Runsa, I want to kill Abigail, I want to kill Lonjiku, I want to kill so many of those fuckers, those who stood by, those who took, every single one that went to those services and took what that moron Tobyn said seriously.<br><br>	
			&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;or the spear that X likes<br><br>
			&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Entry  - 1 Calistril, 4706<br>
			&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I got to the cave today, and bashed down the wall.  It was easier than I expected.<br><br>
			&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I found a whole catacombs there.  a temple to mother. she's had dreams about me too.  we talked about a lot.  She showed me the runewell.  told me about our god, about what this place is.  And about what we should do next.  I asked her to teach me everything she can.  She agreed.<br><br>

			&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Lyrie to help with the rituals,<br> 
			&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Orik to handle the general bodyguard duties,<br>
				&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;we'll be heading to Thistletop soon to get the allegiance of those goblins and figure out what my new dreams mean<br><br>
			&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Getting Tobyn's bones first will at least accelerate my own transformation, but we need a full pyre for true rebirth.<br><br>
			&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;[NHVA]<br>
			&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Nualia<br>

			&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Put the first letter of each name together to form NHVA.<br><br>
			&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;That is our secret name.<br>
			&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Even if we get married and give birth... Even if we are separated, the fact that we are friends will never change.<br>
			&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Let us stop fighting.<br>
			&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Let us stop hating.<br>
			&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Let us pray to the gods that we might live a good life―<br>
			&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Yes, that's right.<br>
			&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Of course, that never became true.<br>
			&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;It never became true.<br>
			&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Ah... but there was something else that happened.<br>
			&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Maybe at the time of our deaths, we'll be together again.<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;;If we get the time we should go to magnimar or Thistletop to look for this group of people X, judge, etc.<br><br>
	&emsp;&emsp;Who are the following people:<br>
		&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Runsa Bowman - The boy Nualia like<br>
		&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Abigail<br>
		&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Bruthazmus<br>
		&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Lyrie<br>
		&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Orik<br>
