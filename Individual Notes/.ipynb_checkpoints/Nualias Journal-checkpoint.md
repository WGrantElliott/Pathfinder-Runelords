## Nualia's Journal

I started school recently.  A lot of the other children are mean to me.  They pick on me,  tease me, call me things like bright eyes or little grandma or fallen angel.  They treat me like i’m a freak!.  Some of the boys were making fun of me, saying that if they touched me it’d cure illnesses they had.  So they’d run by as fast as they could and touch me, but they were running so fast that it hurt, and then they just started to do it faster and faster and faster and it hurt so much.  Headmaster Gandethus stops them from picking on me, but he’s not always there and then they’re meaner to me.  Why are they so mean to me?  I didn’t ask to be like this…  Father tells me this is my blessing from the gods.  I pray to them every night.  I want to know why I was made like this…

There’s a couple of new kids at the academy.  The little sister of those twins, Aneka and Arika, Hazel.  Apparently she’s adopted too.  She’s got weird eyes.  One red and one blue.  Rumor has it that she had claws in the basket, and father Tobyn says they shouldn’t have taken her in, says she’s a bad omen.  Tsuto just gets angry looking at her for her eye shape and hair or something.  I don’t know if I should talk to her though, her sisters give mean looks to anyone that says mean things to her, but they’ve also said some mean things about me…..

### **Entry  - 8 Sarenith, 4693 AR**
I was out playing during recess and I went for a walk around the school.  Most of the kids dont go there, but I saw the red-eyed girl there.  I...I was scared of her.  She looked so strange.  But I remembered seeing how all the other kids treated her...and how they treated me too.  How they called me strange, and a freak, and names.  The girl was just sitting there, by herself, huddled up, and she was reading a book.  I dont even think she noticed me at first.  It was nice out, so I sat down against the wall too.  Not real close though.  And she heard me sitting down and I think I scared her…  She got up and ran off somewhere.  I went to look for her but I couldn't find her anywhere.  She’s good at hiding.  I wish I could do that.

### **Entry  - 9 Sarenith, 4693 AR**
Its been a few weeks, but when I look at the weird girl, Hazel?  She seemed scared of me kinda...She always looks away when she looks at me so quickly, but she looks a little confused too.  I’m starting to think she has pretty eyes.  Every time I see her, she’s almost always reading.  She doesnt talk much in class at all, but i think she’s smart.  I’m gonna try to talk to her.  Maybe we could be friends?  I dont have any friends…

After school I went to the market with Father.  We were buying some fish for dinner and the fish market man was asking father what he had planned for this week’s sermon when an old lady came up and grabbed my hair.  She cut my hair!  Only a little bit, but she looked so happy about it.  I was crying and father said it was part of my blessing from the gods.  People thought my hair had magical powers.  I asked him if it was true and he quietly told me he didnt think so, but it was our duty to be servants to the people of sandpoint for the gods, and my heavenly heritage was a sign of that.  I didn’t say that lady could take my hair!  I didn’t say I wanted to be a servant for her!  (there are tears splattering the page here.)

### **Entry  - 21 Sarenith, 4693 AR**
I found Hazel behind the school again during recess, but this time some little boys had found her and were taking her book and teasing her.  It made me SO mad!!  How could they be so mean!?  I dont remember even wanting to do it, but I remember running at one of the boys who was teasing her and I shoved him down and he fell and hurt his arm a little, and he started to cry and ran off…  the other little boys ran off after him.  Father was mad at me for it, but they deserved it.  I had to say I was sorry, but I didn’t mean it.

Hazel looked scared of me afterwards, but when I talked to her, she seemed to calm down a little.  I asked if I could sit with her for recess and she said yes.  So I sat there and...and i cried a little.  I was just so mad!!  I couldn’t help it.  Hazel sat there with me and i just cried.  Headmaster Gandethus came a little later.  One of the boys told him what had happened, and he saw me crying and asked me what had happened and i told him how it was their fault and how they were teasing Hazel and taking her book and picking on her and how mean they were.  Headmaster said he’d talk to the boys, but that I couldnt do that.  It wasnt right to hurt them.  But they were hurting Hazel?  And they hurt me…

### **Entry  - 4 Abadius, 4697 AR**
(there are what look like tear splotches that have dried on the paper)

I can’t believe they’re still doing this to me.  There was a boy i liked...Runsa Boman.  I’ve liked him for awhile now, but none of the boys ever really paid attention to me or talked to me unless it was to make fun of me.  But Boman said he wanted to talk to me today, and he asked me if I would be his girlfriend and go on a date with him.  I was so excited and happy...I said yes right away, and he asked me if I would go for a walk with him during recess time.  We went for our walk, and I tried to hold his hand, but he pulled his hand away…  And when we got behind the school, there were some other boys there.  They said things like “I can’t believe you actually did it!” and they were laughing, saying they couldnt believe I’d fell for that and that I was a slut…  I just...i started crying and i ran and they were laughing and my face was hot and I was angry...so angry and ashamed…  He never liked me at all...He thought i was a freak.  A monster...I heard him say it when i ran away.  I went and just ran and found Hazel and cried and cried and cried and she held me and cried too.  She’s my only friend in this world…

WHY IS THIS HAPPENING TO ME 

I pray to Desna and Abadar and Erastil and Gozreh and Sarenrae and Shelyn every single night!  I ask them to teach me.  To tell me why.  I beg them!  And none of them answer me.  Why would they make me like this?

### **Entry - 7 Gozran, 4697 AR**
We got a new………. Kid, at the church orphanage.  At first I thought it was an alligator, but father insisted that it was a boy.  A lizardman or something.  More like a lizardboy.  He keeps chewing on the furniture.  Though when he wasn’t being bad he was normally quiet and starring off into space.  Kind of weird.

### **Entry - 12 Erastus, 4697 AR**
I’ve been put by father in charge of teaching Vesh how to read, write, and not chew on things.  It’s annoying, but it means I can spend more time inside instead of going on the walks around town with father getting touched by people, or at school with those boys.  

I talked to the headmaster, and he gave me some advice and books.  For some reason his advice was to explain everything related to food first.  I’m not sure, but he got apple fast when I cut one up and gave him slices for each letter he got right.  He wanted meat though, and I’m not sure how to tell him I can’t get him that.  Father told me meat is only for special moments and we need to abstain otherwise.  And I’m not sure teaching Vesh is a special moment.  But I also noticed that father lets Vesh eat whatever he wants, and I think that’s unfair.  

Why does he get to have so many special moments?

### **Entry - 1 Desnus, 4698 AR**
After a lot of begging father finally started letting Vesh go to school too.  Which is good, there’s only so much I can take of struggling to explain school things to him, and him just repeatedly asking why without getting what I’m saying.  I think he gets why I’m frustrated though, and he’ll normally end the lessons on time.  Or he’s just bored too.  I did find out though that apparently there’s more like him, out in the swamp?  And the fishermen sometimes take him with them so he can visit his people?

If there’s a lot of freaks like him, why does he keep coming back here?  If I was him, I’d stay there.

I wish there was a place for freaks like me out there.

### **Entry - 21 Lamashan, 4698 AR**
I don’t know how I ended up a ring leader for all the weirdos.  I guess it makes sense because I’m the oldest, I am 14, but I have Vesh, Hazel, and now Ameiko following me around after class!

Well, Ameiko is apparently just trying to meet Tsuto, but secretly.  Her dad doesn’t want them to meet since Tsuto is a bastard.  I don’t know why that’s a bad thing though, Mr Lonjiku is mean, and his mom might have met someone she actually loved.  Saying that when I was at dinner with the Avertin’s might not have been the best idea though, Hazel didn’t know what I meant, Aneka and Arika burst out laughing and Arika called me dumb, Mrs Averin got upset and Casp had to step out, he was having trouble breathing and his dad kept hitting his back.

You’d think Casp would be smarter than to choke on his food, being a guard and all.

### **Entry - 20 Kuthona, 4698 AR**
Well, as much as this might get me in trouble if Dad ever found out, Vesh lead Hazel, Ameiko, Tsuto, and I out to the swamp.  We had to hid in fishbarrels though, stowing away onto one of the fishing ships.  It was gross.  But we snuck over the edge to see what Vesh wanted to show us.  And it was just a swamp.

And well, we were just standing there confused as to why he was showing us a swamp, the fishermen of course noticed us.  Thankfully they didn’t turn us over to my dad.  That would’ve been almost as bad as being caught with a boy.

But according to them what Vesh was wanting to show us was where he hatched, not actually his tribe.  Apparently he was exiled or something?  I’m not sure but one of the men apparently had some knowledge of how the lizardfolk thought.  

And they thought Vesh was to smart.  Psh.

But still, he was kicked out because he was different.  So he really is an orphan with no where else to go.

Imma teach him all the prayers to Desna tomorrow.

### **Entry  - 20 Pharast, 4700 AR**
I think I get it now.  When Father first asked me to work in the cathedral with him, I didn’t want to, but I couldn’t say no either.  I can’t keep up with my homework as much now, but father says it won’t matter too much in the end.  But I think I really do get it now.  I’m a little happier now.  The people of sandpoint come to the cathedral.  They say I’m holy.  They say I’m sent by the divine to help save them, and I listen to their stories and their pains.  And I can understand them.  I’ve felt that pain too.  The gods did bless me.  They have chosen me to serve them, and they knew that while it would be hard, I could do it.  That's why they gave me all these hard things.  They knew the people would need me.  I dont get to see Hazel as much anymore.  She’s busy with her schoolwork and she says she’s even studying magic now, and that Headmaster Gandethus promised to teach her.  I miss her, but I still get to see her sometimes.  She’s like my sister.

### **Entry  - 15 Abadius, 4701 AR**
I was working at the cathedral today, Delek Viskanta came by again today.  He comes by a lot now.  He always seems happy to see me.  It makes me happy to see him.  He’s so nice to me.  He even brought a flower today, a white lily.  He said it reminded him of me, and my beautiful hair.  I think he likes me.  I like him.  But Father won't like it.  Father says I can’t have a boyfriend, that boys only want one thing and that I have to remain pure so I can serve the gods.  But why would the gods bring Delek to me then?

### **Entry - 21 Calistril, 4701 AR**
I went on a date with Delek!  I was so excited!!  He’s so nice and sweet.  He tells me my hair is beautiful and how much he loves my purple eyes, like he’s looking up at the heavens themselves.  We had to go somewhere private, but Delek said he found these secret tunnels under the town when he was a child, and we could be alone there without anybody finding us.  I dont care that we’re in tunnels underground.  It’s not scary or bad if I’m with him, and the way he held me and made love to me.  I never felt so happy before.

### **Entry  - 3 Gozran, 4701 AR**
It’s been about a month and a half since Delek and I started dating.  I dont get to see him too often, but when we can we go to the tunnels and he makes love to me and holds me like i’ve never been loved before...but I havent had my period this month…  I’m late by two weeks.  I’m worried.  I think I’m pregnant…  I know I’m young but Delek and I love each other.  If I dont get my period next month, I’ll have to tell him and we’ll have to either tell Father or run away together.

### **Entry  - 1 Sarenith, 4702 AR**
(This entry is written in a very harsh, angry scrawl.  Some parts are hard to read because they’ve been written over with things like “NONE OF THEM EVER LOVED ME”)

IT WAS ALL A LIE!!! HE NEVER LOVED ME NEITHER OF THEM DID!!  FATHER NEVER LOVED ME!  DELEK NEVER LOVED ME!!  I TOLD HIM I WAS PREGNANT!  I THOUGHT HE WOULD BE HAPPY BUT I WAS WRONG  HE CALLED ME A SLUT!  A WHORE!   HE SAID HE NEVER LOVED ME AND HE WAS LEAVING AND IT WAS MY PROBLEM!!  

I WENT HOME AND PRAYED AND PRAYED AND PRAYED AND FATHER CAME AND ASKED ME WHAT WAS WRONG AND...AND I TOLD HIM AND I WENT TO HUG HIM HIM AND JUST CRY...AND...AND...HE SLAPPED ME…

HE CALLED ME A COMMON HARLOT AND A SLUT AND TOLD ME I WAS SUPPOSED TO REMAIN PURE SO I COULD JOIN A COVENANT AND I SHOULD BE ASHAMED AND HE DRAGGED ME TO MY ROOM AND LOCKED ME INSIDE AND TOLD ME I COULDNT LEAVE AND HAD BETTER PRAY AND ASK FOR FORGIVENESS I DONT UNDERSTAND WHY WOULD THE GODS DO THIS TO ME

### **Entry  - 15 Sarenith, 4702**
Its been two weeks and father still wont let me leave my room.  He even wont let me into just the cathedral…  He says I should be ashamed and that I have to pray and study…. WHY DID THIS HAPPEN TO ME WHY CAN’T I JUST BE HAPPY 

I miss hazel
          Vesh
          Ameiko

THE GODS ARE LIARS THE GODS ARE LIARS THE GODS ARE LIARS THE GODS ARE LIARS THE GODS ARE LIARS THE GODS ARE LIARS THE GODS ARE LIARS THE GODS ARE LIARS THE GODS ARE LIARS THE GODS ARE LIARS THE GODS ARE LIARS THE GODS ARE LIARS THE GODS ARE LIARS THE GODS ARE LIARS THE GODS ARE LIARS LIARS LIARS LIARS LIARS!!

I GET IT NOW I REALLY GET IT NOW I PRAYED AND PRAYED AND PRAYED THE WHOLE TIME AND NONE OF THEM ANSWERED ME I ASKED DESNA SO MANY TIMES TO HELP ME AND SHE DIDNT ANSWER ME

My baby was born early...my baby...The nursemaids tried to hide it from me.  They wouldnt let me see it, but i could tell.  I SAW THE TRUTH MY BABY WAS A MONSTER!!! A FIEND!!! THEY TOOK MY BABY FROM ME AND GOT RID OF IT.  I COULDNT STAND IT!!

I woke up 3 weeks later and they said father said I had been in a coma.  He told me to pray to the gods and ask for forgiveness, and that he would be sending me to the nuns next week…  

IDIOT

I prayed to desna...and I heard an answer, but it wasnt desna.  It was the mother...MY MOTHER

She told me what to do...lock his door, put the bookcase in front of it, and set the cathedral on fire

I ran away to Magnimar. I think Delek was going there...I’m going to find him.  And i’m going to make him pay!!  Mother promised me so much...she’s shown me the truth, the reality of life.  She’s the mother of monsters.  She gave birth to monsters, to us.  To ALL OF US  We’re all monsters inside, and i’m she told me I could get rid of my celestial taint and finally become whole and true.  I’m going to find Delek AND I’M GOING TO KILL HIM

### **Entry  - 25 Rova, 4702**
I snuck aboard a ship heading to Magnimar, doing the same thing of hiding inside a fish barrel like we had done in the past.  It was easy to do while the town was panicking and running around like cocks with their heads cut off, and while I had to wait a while for the ship to depart, no one checked anything.  I ate the fish in that barrel throughout the trip, and drank what water flowed in from the rain.

I didn't get out for the whole trip, not until I could hear the men's voices talking and things being moved.  During a moment of silence I got out and dove into the bay, the way Vesh taught me, and swam to the docks.  From there though, I didn't have much choice but to wander around, soaked, and ask around if anyone had seen someone like Delek.  nothing though, this town is to big.  So I stayed at some seedy in to stretch what money I could from what I stole from the churches coffers, and the money I took from the men that tried to break into my room that first night.

### **Entry  - 27 Rova, 4702**
A man met with me, who said that his leader wanted to speak to a fellow worshipper of mother.  it felt like such a sign I went along with it.  That's how I met X and the judge.  While the judge talked in big grandiose words about Father Skinsaw, X was more to the point, all smiles and silk, but I knew there was more to her than there was to the judge.  she was more like me, and she knew mother too.  They told me they would help me find Delek, and so much more.

### **Entry  - 1 Lamashan, 4702**
They made me wait an extra day, but only so that it would be the first day of mothers month to honor her, but I was finally able to find Delek.  He had been had a rich whore house, amusingly.  He had been fucking a white haired whore.  I suppose he has a type.

X laughed hard when she saw that I had carved both of them up.  It's a good thing she had cast a silence, or else we certainly would've been caught.  She said it was unfornate that Delek was lustful instead of greedy, though I'm not sure what that has anything to do with it.  She gave me a seven pointed star necklace, and told me to wear it always, and that it would lead me to more allies.

She took me back to the judge and his cult, and we celebrated.  But I found myself craving more.  the judge noticed this, though I'm sure X already knew.  He offers to help me, though he told me to be honest with what I want.

I want...... to kill that old woman that took my hair.  I want to kill that boy that always crushed my favorite flower at the academy.  I want to kill Delek's family who spawned such a horrible person, I want Runsa, I want to kill Abigail, I want to kill Lonjiku, I want to kill so many of those fuckers, those who stood by, those who took, every single one that went to those services and took what that moron Tobyn said seriously.

I want to kill sandpoint.

X smiled and rubbed my shoulders and said I would, I just needed help.  I need to be stronger.

They're going to help me.

### **Entry  - 5 Sarenith, 4703**
My arms are tired.  I've been doing my best to learn those smaller blades the cult likes, or the spear that X likes, but they just don't do it for me.  I can't move my arms like that.  My new sword though feels right, it's just so heavy though.

I go got it a few days ago.  I did see a man, maybe a mercenary? carrying a very large sword.  He spends a lot of money on different things, and plays lots of cards to get more.  I haven't seen him do many jobs though.  The sword is beautiful though.

With X's help we lure him to a room and gut him.  She puts some mark on him first.  I don't pay to much attention to that though, more distracted with the very sharp sword I now have.

my dreams have been acting up again.

### **Entry  - 11 Desnus, 4705**
I FOUND YOU.

### **Entry  - 13 Neth, 4705**
My dreams have been of sandpoint.  of that cave delek and I met.   I visited where I threw his body.  A little cove.  I can't see his skeleton anymore.  It's flesh had been stripped by fish not long after I threw it there, but I liked to come see it sometimes.  I liked to ask it what we should've named our child.  If it was a boy or girl.  Something chelish.  I don't like Varisians.  Maybe chestnut for a girl?  kind of like hazel.  for a boy though...........  that bitch had said it had been a monster, while I thrashed and they took them away.  If it was a monster, and a boy, maybe something lizardfolk.  something stupid, like Ves.

### **Entry  - 14 Abadius, 4706**
X said I should follow my dreams.  They want me to go back to that cave, to the bricked up tunnel.  I go back to the cove.

I don't feel anything for it.

Getting a ship back is easy.  I'll need to be careful not to be noticed.

### **Entry  - 31 Abadius, 4706**
Ameiko has a tavern near the docks.  Hazel still works at the bakery.  I didn't see Casp anywhere.  Vesh is working on building a new church.

I don't feel anything for it.

### **Entry  - 1 Calistril, 4706**
I got to the cave today, and bashed down the wall.  It was easier than I expected.

I found a whole catacombs there.  a temple to mother.

and Erylium.

she's had dreams about me too.  we talked about a lot.  She showed me the runewell.  told me about our god, about what this place is.  And about what we should do next.  I asked her to teach me everything she can.  She agreed.

### **Entry  - 27 Gozran, 4707**
This will probably be my last entry.  I'll be leaving the book here, as the last part of my past.  The plan is mostly ready now.  I have Tsuto wrapped around my finger, and with the additional help of Bruthazmus to track down the goblins, Lyrie to help with the rituals, and Orik to handle the general bodyguard duties, we'll be heading to Thistletop soon to get the allegiance of those goblins and figure out what my new dreams mean.  Once we have those goblins, we'll get the other four tribes.  After that I'll let Tsuto and the others figure out the plan.  As long as Sandpoint burns it doesn't matter.  Getting Tobyn's bones first will at least accelerate my own transformation, but we need a full pyre for true rebirth.

If there's anything I regret at this point....... It's that I wasn't born a demon in the first place.

(There is a small note written in the back of the journal.  Looks like this part is older than the more recent entries, though there is no date.)

[NHVA]
Nualia
Hazel
Vesh
Ameiko

Put the first letter of each name together to form NHVA.
That is our secret name.
Even if we get married and give birth... Even if we are separated, the fact that we are friends will never change.
Let us stop fighting.
Let us stop hating.
Let us pray to the gods that we might live a good life―
Yes, that's right.
Of course, that never became true.
It never became true.
Ah... but there was something else that happened.
Maybe at the time of our deaths, we'll be together again.
